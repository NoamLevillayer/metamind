The idea of a standup routine would be recorded and submitted to TV Network, and they'd think it was worth airing is a stretch. The idea that 3 people being killed on a subway would be a catalyst for a city-wide revolt is as crazy as people thinking this movie's release would lead to anarchy. And that's part of the point. We are not supposed to believe this narrative. This pity party but also self-aggrandizing tripe is the type of stuff that a psycho would come up with to justify his actions.

Don't talk shows and tv studios in general screen all guests? Ignoring this potential wide open plot hole, I found the material almost entirely sad, dour and glum with little else to offset while enduring scene by scene.

There's only one thing that I could say about this film and that is that it's a masterpiece, a 10 out of 10. Everything was spot on from the story, the acting and the music. The film is about Arthur Fleck and he has a laughing disabilitie. He wants to be seen but he feels like he's not. Arthur did some horrible things and eventually became the Joker. The story is dark just like some other DC films. It's a good thing that it's dark because how else would you tell the story of the Joker. The story really focusses on Joker and not on other heroes or villains in Gotham like Batman. Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic as Joker. He played Joker so good that he's in my top 3 of Joker performances of all time. His acting made him so good. The laugh that he did was incredible. The amount of weight he lost for this role is insane. You could see his bones so that is how skinny he was. His dances were also great. The stair scene when he's dancing on them is the best scene in the movie. The make-up artists did an amazing job with the clown make-up. The clown make-up and his costume is different from other Jokers. The sets and film locations are beautiful. The darkness and sometimes the bright colors looked great in every scene. The music is also great. 'That's Life' is perfect for Joker. I got goosebumps from every scene when 'That's Life' played because it felt epic. I would highly recommend this film for everyone who loves DC Comics and superhero movies. The story is great and the acting is fantastic. The Oscar was well deserved for Joaquin Phoenix and always remember: ""That's Life.""",SHOW MORE,,

This is more of a modern day, realistic version of the Joker, I think it works a lot better this way. Joaquin did a phenomenal job as the joker, showing all the crazy, messed up emotions and action and the hysterical laughing, couldn’t think of a better actor for this role. The movie starts off a little bit loud in my opinion, there’s a lot going on at once, and music is constantly playing. It didn’t really feel like an intro, we just jumped in right away. I think this is a good and bad thing, it didn’t really feel like I had time warming up to the movie, rather it just felt pretty busy from the get go. But also a good thing, since this just adds to the uneasiness of the movie, which I felt during the whole movie, I hope this was their goal, because they did a good job. However, the movie felt too “cinematic”. The quality was crystal clear, some parts felt acted, and music filled the entirety of the movie. I felt like I was watching a movie, instead of experiencing this film. Amazing job, and a good watch",SHOW MORE,,

Phoenix’s performance is nothing short of mesmerizing and easily deserves the Oscar he won. The movie keeps you on edge, slowly building tension as it shows Fleck’s transformation into the Joker. The character development is impressive, making Fleck’s journey feel real and tragic. The film also does a great job of showing how society’s neglect can push someone to the edge. Visually, Joker stands out with its dark, gritty background contrasted by flashes of color, symbolizing Fleck’s rare moments of joy, mostly through his unsettling laughter. Overall, Joker is a chilling and unforgettable experience. It gives us a version a version of the Joker that feels authentic and human, not just a comic book villain.

Lo cierto es que este personaje se ha vuelto uno de los más populares marcando la cultura popular. Hacer una película sobre él iba a ser algo dudoso, pero terminaron haciendo una película muy prometedora con un estilo del Hollywood clásico. Joker ha tenido diferentes versiones y diferentes orígenes que no son muy claros cuál es el auténtico. El mismo Joker no tiene recuerdos de su propio pasado, así que hay muchas posibilidades. Aquí decidieron hacer una historia de origen mucho más realista, con un Joker bastante humano y con una interesante crítica social que cuestiona la moral establecida por la sociedad. Joaquin Phoenix brinda una asombrosa actuación encarnando un Joker bastante trágico. Aquí el icónico villano es alguien lleno de dolor que vive en una ciudad donde no hay sentido de justicia y los menos afortunados son los que sufren más. Joker, bajo la identidad de Arthur, es alguien que vive en los sectores bajos y que sufre problemas debido a la inestabilidad social. Al inicio es asaltado, luego es despedido injustamente y cuando tiene la oportunidad de defenderse de otros asaltantes sus acciones son consideradas un crimen contra la sociedad. Es peor cuando Arthur va descubriendo la verdad sobre su madre y sobre las figuras que él consideraba ideales como Thomas Wayne y Murray Franklin. Arthur se convierte en una bomba a punto de estallar y al perder acceso a los medicamentos que lo mantenían estable por culpa del recorte, Arthur va perdiendo el control. Se puede concluir que Joker es una víctima de las circunstancias y la poca atención de una sociedad injusta ha impedido que él obtuviera la ayuda que necesitaba para no convertirse en un psicópata. Arthur se da cuenta de que está viviendo en una sociedad injusta donde a nadie le importa su dolor y por eso decide dejar salir su lado más salvaje. Si bien Joker puede parecer un psicópata, todo lo que sucede a su alrededor demuestra que él tiene razón. A veces la gente se deja llevar tanto por la idea de lo bueno y lo malo implantado por la sociedad, que no se toman la molestia de plantearse si todo en la sociedad está bien. El detonante es cuando Joker acaba con la vida de tres empleados de Wayne Enterprises que lo han atacado y las noticias retratan a estas personas como víctimas. Eso hace que Joker quede pintado como un vilano, pero gana apoyo por parte de los menos afortunados. Ciudad Gótica tiene un serio problema económico y vemos como la gente harta de su situación actual decide recurrir a la violencia, inspirados por Joker. Tiene sentido porque de qué sirve respetar el orden en una sociedad donde no hay justicia para los más desafortunados. Las acciones de Joker contra sus asaltantes son vistas como algo malo, pero nadie sabe lo que ha pasado realmente. La realidad es que no se sabe a ciencia cierta si la víctima de un asesinato fue alguien realmente inocente, porque detrás de un crimen hay una razón. Si es por algo que la víctima hizo para dañar de cualquier forma a su futuro victimario, entonces el crimen está justificado. Las acciones de Joker están justificadas, si se deja de lado la moral. Muchas veces alguien comete un crimen contra la sociedad debido a que la sociedad lo trato injustamente o nadie respondió el grito de auxilio del individuo cuando más lo necesitaba. Eso justifica bastante las acciones de alguien, por más que la sociedad lo vea como algo malo. Analizando el paradigma completo, la verdad es que no existe tal cosa como lo bueno y lo malo y tampoco la persona inocente como tal. Si las acciones de Joker fueran algo totalmente repudiable, no hubiese tenido apoyo de los manifestantes. Así que si un psicópata comete tales actos porque al ver su historial se descubre que no ha tenido un trato justo por parte de la sociedad, entonces esa persona tiene razón en hacer lo que hace. Si el ser humano como tal nace con la capacidad de hacer lo inenarrable, entonces la sociedad misma es quien lo forja y lo corrompe de forma directa o indirecta. La misma sociedad es la que crea a sus monstruos. Joker termina siendo una excelente historia de origen, desarrollando su trasfondo psicológico y haciendo que podamos entender sus acciones. No es una película de acción, pero es un gran drama psicológico con una buena historia que explica como Ciudad Gótica fue invadida por el crimen antes de la llegada de Batman. Una sociedad inestable da origen a una ola de crimen insostenible. No se sabe si Thomas Wayne era un hombre humilde, pero Bruce demostró ser mejor al no recurrir a métodos extremos cuando se convirtió en Batman. Aunque sea una historia independiente sin relación con el universo cinematográfico de DC, Joker logra ser una de las mejores películas de DC Comics que nos ha brindado una de las mejores versiones de este icónico villano. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10.",SHOW MORE,,

Joker is a very dark, very heavy, very telling film that carefully swings between mass appeal and arthouse. A film where the main villain is society and madness follows a chain from the political system to the economy to the economy to the mentality. People become poor, angry, aggressive and God forbid Arthur comes under this hand, because if a clown becomes a symbol of the Rebellion, then isn't this true madness? A down-to-earth and gloomy Goth, oppressive music and at the head of all this villain, Joaquin Phoenix, is certainly the main advantage of the film. This is a benefit performance of an actor who, it seems, as in life, was not particularly friendly with reason, but here he gives a complex, multi-layered and truly scary image. But although how much can you crucify about what a strong film this is? Joker made such a strong resonance and renaissance in the superhero movie genre that it brought the main prize of the Venice Film Festival and a billion dollars to Warner Bros., thereby becoming the highest-grossing R-rated film in the history of cinema. And Joker certainly became the brightest film of 2019 and absolutely deserved it. It is even now one of my favorite films.",SHOW MORE,,

I understand as well that this is kind of an attempt of mixing a fictional character with a human being. That purpose alone works, at least for me, I was very happy with the way most of the movie unfolded. But…I also acknowledge that by doing so—trying to humanize a fictional character—this movie also shows clearly what being a white man means. It’s obvious for the viewer, if you have common sense, that what happens in the film happens because the character is white and a man. That being said, Joaquin performance is brilliant. The pace was great I just wish there was a little more development of Joker phase. Other than that I think it is a piece of art.",SHOW MORE,,

Some may say that it isn't really a Joker movie and is basically just a random bloke called Arthur Fleck masquerading as the Joker, but the way I see it, it is. The Joker's philosophy is that all it takes to become like him is one bad day. This movie basically embodies that philosophy. All it took Arthur to begin the path to becoming the Clown Prince of Crime was one bad day where he got fired from his job and beaten up by 3 people on the subway. It fits the character well. Even if Joker 2 takes the plot in a very different (and still good) direction, this movie still holds up as an amazing Joker origin story.",SHOW MORE,,

Masterpiece. I don't like calling films masterpieces or incredible very often, but I also can't get this film out of my head since I watched it. Joker is one of those movies that sticks with you. For what it was trying to do (creating a serious drama driven comic book film), the film passes with flying colours. First and foremost, this is NOT a movie for everyone. It's rated R for a reason, and it's subject matter and the manner that the film progresses quite possibly be off putting for some people. It's a harrowing experience to see how Arthur Fleck lives from the beginning of the film, and it is also deeply disturbing how he transforms from a depressed outcast to becoming a horrible and maniacal villain. Joaquin Phoenix takes what Heath Ledger brought to the character in The Dark Knight, and creates a different look for the character. You progress from feeling bad for the guy to becoming genuinely terrified of what he will do/think next. Joaquin does an amazing job of creating the journey of Arthur with just subtle changes to his body language and delivery of dialogue from scene to scene. Todd Phillips does a spectacular job of reinventing his visual and story telling methods (even with the obvious nods to previous Martin Scorsese films). The cinematography is incredible and the music is haunting. It's a film that holds your attention and refuses to let go. Probably the best film of the year and one of the best of this decade!

It also shows the side affects of somebody who has been kicked out of society and therefore feels the need to rebel, when Joker says the line ''If it was me dying on the sidewalk you’d walk right over me'' which implies the fact that the 3 guys were favoured because they were richer and thats why people care so much. This relates to the real world because in most cases the people with the most money get treated and recognized more, also in Gotham at that time most of the people thats would’ve been labeled poor felt this way and thats why when Arthur decided to stand up for himself the rest felt obligated to do so. This movie gives perspective to people maybe dealing or suffering with a mental illness or poor mental health, it gives viewers a look inside what that persons life is like or how much they have to deal with. There is one scene on the bus when Arthur is making a child smile and the mother tells him to stop bothering her child and he starts laughing because when he’s under pressure he can’t help but laugh from head damage he obtained as a child, he gives her a card explaining his condition but she justs looks at him like he’s crazy. This makes the audience feel sympathy and sadness towards Arthur but there is also a realisation that this is a real life situation and when people admit to having a mental illness or a mental health condition we just stereotype them and label them crazy or insane. People hate murders and killers but we are the ones who create them, we label people fucking insane and call them a lost cause. Now im not justifying murder here but were partially to blame for living in this fucked up society which we always complain about. But no, it always someone elses fault never our own, everybody wears they’re own mask when they’re really dying on the inside.",SHOW MORE,,

Did anyone consider the potential for deceit, when the bully guard (Played by Brendan Gleeson), in an uncharacteristic kind act, effectively takes Arthur to meet Harleen (Lee) at the choir? As the film progresses, we find out from Arthur's Lawyer who Harleen really is. Did she lure him in with him with a false personal story or do they really have a connection, a Folie a Deux? Arthur questions Harleen who further reels him. Arthur then ignores his lawyer's motherly warning. At this point he totally smitten with Harleen. In my opinion Arthur's lawyer was the only character who genuinely cared for him. She was wise to the institution harm at Arkham: she understood the neglect and torture that was inflicted on Arthur by the guards, and psychological torment belitting him, e.g., they mock how easy he was to catch, through his unstrategic crime to kill someone live on TV. Arthur's lawyers pleads insanity and builds a defense case highlighting his abusive childhood, to help him avoid the death sentence. It was Harleen that drove the wedge between them. Ultimately Arthur fires his lawyer and represents himself dressed as the joker. He talk about folie! Harleen being a honey trap would also explain how she manages to bend the rules of the prison regime over and over again. For example gaining private access to his cell where the films' sex takes place (its depiction is the antithesis of porn: bleak and over in a flash). The only problematic scene would be the fire during the movie night at Arkham. If Harleen was really working as some kind of undercover agent, then would it be plausible for her to go that far to destroy property? It was a reckless move but it paid off in gaining Arthur's trust. On reflection it was another example of her managing to evade consequence to her actions and instead is released from the jail. Ultimately Lee breaks up with him, at the very moment that their fantasy to live together as a family could have become true. She appears to be disappointed in him, for taking an unprecedented move to admit in the court room that he's not mentally ill. But I think that was exactly what she wanted to happen. I think she was a honey trap, planted whether working alone or undercover in cahoots with New York state and her doctor father, on a mission to lead him to Arthur to his demise. I think sabotage Arthur's chances of winning his freedom during the trial: the State of New York versus Arthur Fleck.",SHOW MORE,,

And that’s usually where very good things happen. Todd and Scott Silver’s screenplay has that relevance that occurs when work is authentic and not derivative. We find Arthur disturbing and poignant simultaneously. He’s both child victim and adult perpetrator. Both are true, as is the case with most schizophrenics. That both are true is uncomfortable. We find ourselves in a fugue state. It’s counterpoint. It’s why Arthur and the film’s impact sustains so strongly in memory.

Heath Ledgers Portrayal of the Joker brought us up to the level that could be considered human, just the right balance, in the world of super humans. Fast forward to Jared Leto's Joker in suicide squad and hes a gangster with gold chains and tattoos, Overly humanized. This movie obviously tries to introduce the Joker as just a regular guy, twisted by his upbringing and the lack of respect from the outside world. Yet, it fails to depict the Joker as the brilliant evil genius that he is. In comics and other movie sources it is made clear that the entity known as the Joker has never been diagnosed with any mental illness because of how he can manipulate the therapists trying to label him. In front of one therapists he will portray himself as a cool and calculated sociopath, to another a manic depressive with suicidal tendencies, to another a hysterical, maniacal person completely lacking control of his emotions or a cold blooded Psycopath. It was this skill of manipulation after all, that turned Harlene Quinzel into Harley Quin, the Jokers protege. So, great acting throughout the movie, unfortunately failing due to the script missing the essence of The Joker.",SHOW MORE,,

Phoenix was the only bright part of this movie and im amazed at how he got away with such a performance with such a boring ass story. The cinematography wasnt even good, tho the audio was decent.

His mind dances unravelled through an atmospheric score and underlining lyrics of popular songs, as events that might have happened unfold before us, horrific, darkly humorous, clues to his background scattered like the detritus of a ransacked room. Phoenix gives us as much nuance as we can stand, colouring in right up to the corners, his physicality informing us as much as his words, earning every accolade he received for this. Joker does not conform to the standard fare of comic-inspired film, concentrating on a tiny corner of a dirty laundry basket rather than any kind of wide redemptive or narrative arc. It is not joyful or predictable, but it does leave a lasting impression of a truly troubled mind told in an intriguing way and is a significant contribution to the comic-book oeuvre",SHOW MORE,,

Not to say that this is a terrible movie, but rather still one of the best movies out there when it was released in 2019. We can already say that the acting was amazing, the cinematography was amazing, even the setting was amazing. Not to mention how this sets in about mental illness and social problems when it came to delivering the message from Arthur himself. Funny, if you remember a cartoon called Duckman, I couldn't help but imagine the character of the same name say the same lines as Joker made while also keeping that line in mind since we live in a dysfunctional internet culture of today. Sure, you could say society is as mucky as it normally does, whether you're sane or not. I am aware about Joaquin Pheonix's strict diet to play the role, but one thing I have to say is that it is a job, after all. Sometimes you're dedicated to do as request or turn it down and walk away as it's always been such for decades, whether you work with Hollywood or anywhere else, big or small. Now, about some things that does cross my mind is having to think about the actions that Arthur has done off camera does have me guessing, but technically you'd have to use your sense of imagination to figure out if certain events had happened or not like when he was at his ex-girlfriend's apartment room. Also, I was curious on the jump cut at the ending, which I won't spoil too much, but curious how Arthur had gotten to that after a certain time of event as the ending rolls on. But I digress. For the most, I still had a fun time, had some good laughs and does keep me laser focused from start to finish after seeing this again for the second time, especially before I see this sequel for myself. I'd give it nine dancing Arthur's out of ten. 9/10.",SHOW MORE,,

Which is both a good thing, and a bad thing. I went in with an idea that this was going to be a strange movie, and I was not disappointed. The positives were pretty much the same as the previous Joaquin Phoenix interpretation. A stellar performance, although getting a second Oscar for playing the character would probably be a reach. The story was well written, and although I wasn't a big fan of the first movies ending, it seems that this one a slightly better one, despite the fact that it came from out of the same left field corner alley. I was also skeptical of the fact that it's a musical in the truest sense of the word. Although I admit I was pleasantly surprised that chose to use mostly classic show tune numbers. I'm not a huge Lady Gaga fan, but I thought her and Phoenix played well off each other, resulting in a ""decent"" vocalization performance on both parts, which gave the movie a realism that you don't usually see in musicals. I would have liked to have seen Lady Gaga portray a more ""traditional"" rendition of Harley Quinn, but it's hard to say if she would have been able to pull it off, and still keep a realistic tone in the movie. The fact this, like the previous movie, was only loosely based on the DC comics, was not an issue, although anyone watching this with said notion will be disappointed as they probably were if they saw the first. I'm not sure if this is a primary interpretation of either of the films, but they seem to imply that certain people, for better or for worse, have the ability to ""polarize"" communities as a whole to the point that they lose control of those that are captivated by the mere existence of their fixation.

The film's strength lies in its exploration of Arthur Fleck's descent into madness, blending gritty drama with Gotham City's eerie atmosphere. I love how it keeps you guessing what’s real and what’s imagined, making the audience question Arthur's reality. However, it's a strange choice to connect it to the DC universe, as it feels disconnected from Batman or the traditional Joker character. Story-wise, it heavily mirrors *Taxi Driver* and *The King of Comedy*, which makes it feel less original, but the execution still works. Despite being a bit overrated, it remains an engaging watch with strong visuals and intense emotional depth. It may not be groundbreaking, but *Joker* offers an easy-to-follow, gripping character study that holds up on multiple viewings. Phoenix’s performance alone makes it worth watching again and again. 3.5 stars.",SHOW MORE,,

And if nothing’s going to happen, you’d at least hope for some standout characters to carry the weight, but even that fell short. It’s one of those films that tries to be deep but ends up feeling a bit hollow.",SHOW MORE,,

Are we born mad or made mad or a bit of both? Even after the great plot twist it's never clear what is real and what isn't. It's a portrait of madness and the fallout asking uncomfortable questions. It's one of the darkest if not the most disturbing comic book movie ever made. But also an All Time Classic. Really the only issue is it fits ALOT of ideas into under 2 hours extremely well but it can feel a stuffed more than bloated but the editing is really good still.

The character is emotionally charged and disturbingly authentic. Phoenix's body language, voice and facial expressions take us deep into the mysterious and painful world of Arthur Fleck. Phoenix so immersed himself in the character that this is reflected in interviews years after the film was made. Let's hope that only in his mind is the character still in action. When it comes to why it's simply brilliant the answer lies in the fact that most of the film is based on a worldview through the eyes of a maniac. He does evil and is evil but doesn't realise it himself. But aren't there people like that around us in everyday life? In a sense, the Joker is right. Who is competent enough to say what a comedy is. If we ourselves laugh at something inappropriate on a daily basis then we too can feel the mockery of others. However, why do these people have the right to say what and how things should be. In the film directed by Todd Phillips, the story was also very thought provoking. When you look at the madness that a member of a downward spiralling society, who no one cares about, has to deal with, you start to think to yourself, what are my behaviours when I see a 'different' person. You never know what problems a stranger has to deal with both mentally and physically. The Joker is also a visually striking film. Gotham City is portrayed in a dark and decadent tone that has a chilling effect. The film's cinematography, set design and costumes create a tense atmosphere that fully engages the viewer. However, this is the film's biggest problem. It is too focused on one character and the acting of the supporting cast leaves a lot to be desired. Personally, I am a big Robert De Niro fan, but this was definitely not one of his strongest roles.",SHOW MORE,,

I don't think so. 2. The story's themes had been done better in other movies decades ago.

It's basically a Taxi driver, King of comedy mashup with a hint of Falling down with a Batman coat of paint slapped on it.",SHOW MORE,,

The whole film was enjoyable, though I would say that the second half is far better than the first half, and it's not particularly close. If the whole movie was as good as the second half, it would probably be a five-star. That's not to say the first half wasn't compelling or good, but it just couldn't really match the second half. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is nothing short of amazing, with his near-perfect portrayal of Arthur's descent into madness, which is a great time to watch. The overarching plot is also very well written, witch kept my eyes glued to the screen for nearly the entire runtime. This film was also really lacking in side characters, with almost all of them being very forgettable and uninteresting, which really left only one good character (albeit one very good character) carrying its entire 122 minute runtime.

There is nothing wrong with mental illness, but insanity was the every foundation of the joker to me and that's gone now. I do not wish to spoil to the movie for you if you insist on seeing it, but I'll make a comparison to help convey what you will experience. Imagine Batman was actually Batman because he used to be a baseball player and wanted to make a pun, and he has a medical condition that causes his voice to go deeper. Also he actually refuses to kill anyone because he stopped seeing his imaginary friend when he was little, and doesn't want to see anyone else he meets disappear.

But this is an empty, superficial movie that doesn't offer any context about violence beyond what the average viewer would bring to it. I can't begin to understand the adulation this received. I won't fault Phoenix's work here - he is as committed as ever. But this is yet another case of a brilliant actor being rewarded for the wrong film. This is an ugly movie, both aesthetically and beneath the surface. Comparisons to TAXI DRIVER were made upon its release; and while I think TAXI DRIVER is a bit overrated, it is miles ahead of this movie, and I didn't find any similarities beyond a disgruntled protagonist. If you want to see a movie about the destruction of a man due to the world around him, please check out Jake Gyllenhaal in NIGHTCRAWLER instead. De Niro appears very uncomfortable in a supporting role that obviously will be compared to Jerry Lewis in THE KING OF COMEDY. This is bleak, unremitting and ultimately predictable.

Every single scene of the Movie you wonder is everything that is happening actually real or an illusion inside the head of a madman, from the beginning of the Film where we see Arthur in a white room slamming his head against a door to the ending of the Film where he's in a white room that looks pretty much the same as the white room that he was in at the beginning of the Film it truly makes you you wonder what actually happened at the end of this Movie.
