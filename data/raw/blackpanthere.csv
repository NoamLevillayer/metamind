Ryan Coogler clearly rushed this story after they lost their lead actor but it ultimately causes an unfinished poor quality to this changed story. Let’s face it, the first “Black Panther"" despite being a very average Marvel film was a cultural phenomenon. It was largely over praised by the critics with better reviews than made over $700 million in the US, and was the first comic book movie nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. It was a significant film but not a memorable film. Disney has pumped up the Marvel fan base like crazy. But I think they, like the regular audience I saw “WF” with this afternoon, will be disappointed. The opening act is all about losing and mourning T’Challa, which director Ryan Coogler milks for everything he’s got. They’ve even turned the opening Marvel logo sequence into its own memorial montage. And then there’s the majestic funeral. The only thing they’re missing is lox and bagels at the shivah. Then, however, you have to have a movie — and they don’t. The world is mad at Wakanda for not sharing its vibranium, the magic material in the water under the powerful island country. Even the UN is mad the Wakandans won’t share it with them. (There’s a UN in the Marvel universe? For what purpose?) Eventually enemies arrive to try and dig the stuff up. Tenoch Huerta plays Namor, the leader of the pack, dressed as a gladiator from a 1950s epic. He is no Thanos (Josh Brolin) the really upsetting villain from the Avengers movies. Forget the hype. Namor is silly. There’s never a suggestion he’s going to win. You could almost call this movie “The Woman King,” but that title obviously is unavailable. But with T’Challa gone, he’s briefly succeeded by his mother, the always sensational Angela Bassett. Bassett is a STAR. Unfortunately, her Queen Ramonda exits the movie at the halfway point with not much character development. Letitia Wright’s Shuri becomes the Black Panther, but does not fill the void. The two remaining women — Lupita Nyong’o and Danai Gurira — are top notch but they also are written as supporting players. (Also, once Ramonda has left, Shuri doesn’t seem to miss her much.) Well, nature abhors a vacuum. And that’s what the second act is, even with cameo appearances by Julia Louis Dreyfus and Martin Freeman as rogue CIA agents. Winston Duke as M’Baku flits in and out but isn’t much of a presence. So when this two hour forty one minute extravaganza rolls to a somber ending, the audience just sits there hoping for something to chew on. Eventually they get it: a post credits Marvel when the gorgeous Nakia (the very underused Nyong’o) reveals she had a child with T’Challa who she’s been hiding in Haiti. He will be the Black Panther of the third and final movie. Yes, the audience applauded. I groaned however because that's the worst predictable storytelling soap opera like trope you could use, T'Challa doesn't need a biological son to make this transition to continue the character's legacy. If Boseman had lived, who knows what a sequel would have been like? He really projected heroism and nobility. He was the center of “Black Panther,” you couldn’t take your eyes off of him. Unfortunately, “Wakanda Forever” is a movie with a hole at its center. Boseman’s T’Challa is gone, and the movie doesn’t know how to get around that problem. T’Challa didn’t have a brother or son to replace or succeed him. The original film was already heavily stacked with powerful females, and they are all back. But without Boseman, there’s no movie star, no anchor to continue the story.",SHOW MORE,,

It was an admirable effort to try and overcome the challenge the film faced, but it got to a point where it needed a lead. It was honestly a good subplot though, waiting to see who the next Black Panther will be, and as such it was a good impromptu origin story of sorts. Again, the fake languages and subtitles were too frequent and jarring, as was another nearly three-hour runtime for a non-finale MCU movie.",SHOW MORE,,

I despise how they removed T'Challa? Unless it was some super virus that was sweeping the country that some super villain made then he should not have died. If it was a super virus sweeping the country then we should have seen them fighting for the people and trying to stop it with some cure coming in short order. That was a total cheese maneuver to just have him die in the very beginning. Did you ever tell cooperative stories when you were younger? Then you have one person who decides they don't like where the story is headed and say ""then you wake up"" just so they could change the storyline? That's what this was. For some reason, someone did not want T'Challa to be king so they whacked him in the dumbest way possible. Then there is M'Baku. M'Baku challenged T'Challa for the kingship previously, there is no reason to expect that the day he died M'Baku would not challenge for it again. With no king to defend the throne it would have gone to him. So, M'Baku should have been king throughout the movie. The rest of it could have generally taken place the same way but the focus should not have been on the queen. She would have just been a grieving queen mother and then a worried mother for Shuri. I'm a bit of purist when it comes to the comics so I prefer to keep the movies somewhat grounded in the comics. Namor is Atlantean, not Mayan. Even if we run with the Mayan idea, how did they develop their tech which seems to be ahead of the surface world in many ways (the mini-rebreather for instance)? They were not in a position to share ideas with other nations so most likely their society would have stagnated, not progressed in tech. And the depiction of the poor Mayan's dying from the Spaniards invasion. If we are going to depict the dark side of one culture we should include the dark side of the other. In order to get their deity to give them a sign the Mayan's likely sacrificed someone if not multiple people, likely children. The Mayan culture, just like the Aztec culture, was brutal and evil. I just can't stand cultural whitewashing to make one group look bad over the other. I lost interest in it and didn't finish. The action was decent, the siren idea was cool but again they should have been Atlanteans affiliated with the med and not the Mayans. I wish they hadn't killed off T'Challa and that they would have made the background and developing plot tie together better.",SHOW MORE,,

Let’s start with the weaker aspects. The visuals are noticeably flatter than the first film, with more noticeable green screen use and sequences that are overly dark—especially underwater or nighttime scenes—making action hard to follow both in theaters and at home. While I loved the introduction of Namor and the Mayan-inspired nation, we spend surprisingly little time with this world beyond Namor himself, leaving it underdeveloped. Where the film shines is in its emotional balance and performances. The mix of grief, humor, and action feels more cohesive than in many recent MCU films. The action remains engaging and varied, from Riri’s aerial flight sequences to intense underwater combat. Tenoch Huerta’s Namor is a standout, embodying terror, anger, and compassion all at once. Angela Bassett also delivers one of the franchise’s best performances, channeling strength, grief, and authority with genuine power. While the film is not bad by any means, it doesn’t quite reach the heights of the original, Wakanda Forever is still a worthy successor—anchored by its emotional core, strong performances, and respectful handling of an impossible loss.",SHOW MORE,,

Now I suppose for an American audience that never care about someone bringing a gun to a knife fight it's perfectly acceptable it just sits wrong with any person with an ounce of decency. The ending was horrid.

Even after freeing herself (unbelievably) and facing down ""Villain"" again in his incredibly weakened state she uses a jet engine( which we had previously seen be destroyed) to fry him rather than face him in hand to hand combat.

This sequel may not best or match the previous movie, but it moves the story forward convincingly. Character development is done aptly, especially for Shuri. The Talokan underwater scenes could have been improved upon, the transcendent feel of that world was tame. The biggest praise for Black Panther 2 is the acting. The returning cast members deliver splendid performances (Angela Bassett did the thing), and the new members also match up (Tenoch Huerta Mejía giving a compelling performance.)

Filming was interrupted with rewrites prompting reshoots as the film's release was delayed and Letitia Wright's controversial time on Twitter didn't help matters much. Wakanda Forever was tasked with building on the first film and concluding Marvel's Phase 4 as a new villain enters the picture, and a new hero is forced to step up and become the Black Panther. Wakanda is pressured by the rest of the world to share its vibranium resource, but Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) refuses so these political headbutts soon start to cause dangerous ripples. The bad guy this time is Namor, played by Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who breaks into Wakanda, threatening the country with an attack if he is not given the scientist who designed a machine capable of detecting vibranium. Losing the main actor in the franchise was always going to prove challenging for the filmmakers but the approach taken here feels appropriate: after T'Challa is given a considerable, moving send-off, the story continues and Shuri (Letitia Wright) eventually assumes the mantle. Having not one but two massive funerals in a film as lengthy as this one does hurt the pacing of the movie quite a bit, however. This is definitely a film that could have done with a bit of a trim but one suspects that necessary changes to the script caused the budget to inflate too much already so changing the entire plot was not really an option, which is understandable. All of that aside, this is a good sequel and the best film in Marvel's Phase 4 by far. The action sequences are big and exciting, the cast is on top form, there's plenty of drama and intrigue to hold onto, Namor is an interesting foe who lives in a bit of a grey area like Killmonger did and the new culture that is introduced is fascinating. The film takes what worked so well in the first Black Panther and puts it on a more global scale. On the minus side, the introduction of Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) falls resoundingly flat and Lupita Nyong'o is barely given anything to do as Nakia, a character that has felt criminally underwritten since the first movie. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever isn't a perfect film by any stretch, and it's hardly one of Marvel's very best, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining sequel with new environments to discover, characters going through a lot emotionally and a well done build-up to an all-out war that is worth the watch alone.​Solid.",SHOW MORE,,

The best thing about this movie was the acting. Everybody from the last Black Panther movie were significantly better here. Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett specifically had some of the best performances out of any Marvel movie. Another great thing is the character writing. Shuri is my favorite character because of this movie. She's not an average selfless hero. She cares for her people yes, but her motivations are much more driven by her family. And despite people liking to call her a Mary Sue, she is far from one. She fails in this movie a lot. She also is much more vengeful than many heroes and her arc is overcoming that vengeance. Riri is also better written here. Even with her limited amount of screentime, Coogler's Riri is a better version of Ironheart than Bendis'. Namor was also a pretty good villain. He is worse than Kilmonger, but he is written much better than the majority of anti-heroes. This movie also expanded Wakandan culture and represents Africa well. The CGI was okay and could pass. But CGI was way too evident in this movie. Everett Ross was almost entirely unneccessary and took away from the screentime other characters could've had. His subplot didn't contribute to this movie's plot much either. Riri was set up to be an important character in the first act, but somewhere during act two, she was not used much and I think that's a shame With that being said, I highly recommend this movie.",SHOW MORE,,

The thin plot that supports this films nearly three hour runtime consists of a intercontinental search for vibranium that accidentally uncovers an ancient civilization of, essentially, merpeople that are also quite advanced thanks to their unfettered access to vibranium. The merpeople threaten the existence of Wakanda and therefore they must be stopped. It's all so superficial now that many of the Marvel plotlines feel like unfinished first drafts. The acting is solid enough, without any glaring issues and the special effects look as great as always. It's the writing that continually sets Marvel movies up for failure, or at least disappointment. It's the universe in which the movies inhabit that's distracting as well. At this point the world is so convolutedly different than our own that it can be hard to get invested in the film's presented stakes, which is a charge that could be levied at any number of recent Marvel entries. All told, this Wakanda felt like it took forever to move along and, by the time we make it to the end credits, we're left wondering if we really went anywhere at all.",SHOW MORE,,

After the sad death of former lead actor Chadwick Boseman, Marvel Studios faced a big challenge! How should they proceed with the planned sequel to Black Panther without the main actor? And it's safe to say they had probably the best solution. The film is simply a superhero masterpiece. We follow the journey of Shuri, we see how she has to deal with one blow after another and we see how she has to deal with the grief and anger that eats away at her. You have succeeded perfectly in turning Shuri from a marginal character into a real lead. They were also able to flesh out the supporting characters very clearly. Danai Gurira as General Okoye was again great, as was the entire cast. Okoye also gets a bigger arc in this film than before. She has to deal with her biggest fear, the loss of her title as General of the Dora Milaje. Nakia and M'Baku were also great again, though I would have liked to see more of the them. The two absolute scene stealers are Tenoch Huerta as Namor and Angela Bassett as Ramonda. Namor is arguably one of the best Marvel villains, with a good story and exciting powers, he makes you want more. Ramonda is probably the secret star of the film. Not only does she deliver arguably the most emotional scenes, but she is a great character for the main plot. Angela Bassett performs Oscar ripe. Newcomer Riri Williams aka Ironhearth is also convincing. She is a fun and likable side character with cool action scenes, even if Iron Man Fanboys probably don't see it that way. The action in the movie is great and also the CGI is mostly very good. Especially the underwater city Talokan can convince. The interplay of image and music is perfect. The film probably offers the most beautiful film music in the MCU. The film is quite long, but you don't notice that at all. The quiet pace gives the characters enough time to develop and make us understand how they feel and why they act the way they do. Goosebumps and tears are unavoidable. Alone the this time quiet Marvel intro with pictures and videos of Chadwick Boseman brings tears to your eyes. You can feel the real emotions in this film and that makes it even more powerful. In conclusion, Wakanda Forever is an absolute emotional masterpiece in the superhero industry that has no equal. It manages to honorably say goodbye to Chadwick and at the same time honorably begin a new story.",SHOW MORE,,

Seine Schwester Shuri (Letitia Wright) und die Königin Ramonda (Angela Bassett) trauern und müssen dafür sorgen, dass Wakanda ein sichererer Ort bleibt. Shuri findet ein neues Volk, welches Unterwasser lebt und ebenfalls Vibranium besitzt und in Gefahr gerät bekannt zu werden. Der König Namor (Tenoch Huerta) möchte sein Volk beschützen und ist zu allem bereit. Gibt es Frieden? Ist Wakanda noch stark genug, ohne seinen König und Black Panther? Und wer wird der neue Black Panther? Black Panther Wakanda Forever ehrt am Anfang und am Ende den verstorbenen Black Panther Darsteller Chadwick Boseman. Dies macht er sehr gut und es ist auch emotional anzusehen. Shuri ist in diesem Film der Hauptcharakter und ist hier ernster und reist nicht mehr so viele Witze wie im ersten Teil. Dies liegt daran, da sie in starker Trauer ist. Das kann, aber auch daran liegen, da sie ja jetzt die Hauptdarstellerin ist und es für uns Zuschauer zu nervig wäre, wenn sie zu viel redet und nur Gags macht. Der Film generell wirkt nicht wie ein MCU Film. Es gibt eigentlich keine Erwähnung, anderer Superhelden oder Schurken. Am Anfang denkt man, dass der Film in die politische Richtung gehen wird, was zum Teil auch der Fall ist, aber meiner Meinung nach hätte es noch ein bisschen mehr sein können. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Marvelprojekten gibt es hier, weniger Action und mehr Charakterentwicklungen. Angela Bassett hat mir sehr gut gefallen und hat meiner Meinung nach zu Recht eine Oscarnominierung erhalten. Der Bösewicht des Filmes ist gut erzählt worden und könnte noch interessant für Fortsetzungen werden. Da man hier einen Bösewicht hat, dessen Motiv man nachvollziehen kann. Die Bewohner des Unterwasservolks sahen wie die Menschen aus Avatar aus und ich habe zwar Avatar nie richtig gesehen, aber die Handlung ähnelt sich schon stark. Der Endkampf war eher langweilig und einige Entscheidungen im Film fand ich nicht so toll z.b. was mit General Okoye gemacht wurde. Black Panther Wakanda Forever ist ein eher schwächerer Marvel Film, welcher zwar einen guten Ansatz hat und auch gute Szenen hatte. Aber am Ende hatte ich mir mehr erhofft und ich kann mir Shuri, nicht als neuen Black Panther vorstellen. 7,5/10",SHOW MORE,,

The action was good and they didn't have to force a new Black Panther but actually showed restraint and character development by having Black Panther be needed and by honoring him in the process rather than just replacing him. The Villans were mysterious and so intriguing and powerful, every scene with them was masterful. The Film had memorable scenes along with new surprises and characters and this is why it's one of Marvels best films especially under the circumstances. Bring on Part 3.",SHOW MORE,,

Powerful performances from the main cast, especially Angela Bassett, who gloriously played the Queen of Wakanda. Great acting by Leticia Wright as Shuri, Danai Gurira as Okoye and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia. The events of the movie led to a war between the Wakanda and Talokan. I loved how they presented Namor, in spite of the changes. For me, it was interesting to see him as a Mayan/Aztec. I understand why they didn't use Atlanteans, but I like how they kept the aesthetics. Costume design was beautiful for both tribes. The visual effects and battle sequences were amazing.

Now the movie was dealt a devastating hand with the loss of Chadwick Boseman and they do a pretty good job of both honoring his legacy and character with respect (as they should) and moving the MCU's story into the future. Letitia Wright's Shuri was by far the best candidate to fill the shoes of the Black Panther and she is good in the role and holds a great on-screen presence. Angela Basset gives a very compelling performance, Danai Gurira gives another great performance as Okoye, and Winston Duke keeps bringing new and great energy to M'Baku. This movie falls short with both its villain and its runtime. The movie feels way too long, it takes way too much time to get from point A to point B and the time they spend getting there is almost meaningless. I wasn't a fan of Namor as a villain I think he was another poorly written villain in the MCU especially to compare him to one of the best villains in the form of Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, as they want us to feel sympathetic towards him and they never were able to fully get that across in a good and meaningful way like they did with the film's predecessor.

For such a high-profileBut film it was a boldly meditative, thoughtful way to go ... until the film pressed the Big Reset Button and it turned out that nothing means anything in this world. You can just undo the loss, and the MCU has been struggling ever since. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is also about grief, but for altogether more serious reasons. What was to happen after the tragic loss of the first film's star was an almost impossible decision; I have no doubt this film was made in good faith in regard to that situation. There was no easy route. But the result is a strangely patchy mess, a little of this and a little of that. Some impressive set pieces, an antagonist people whose superpower appears to be singing; on the other hand, some moving stuff and good performances. It's way too long. Way, way too long.

Mais fraco que o 1º, teve o sepultamento de @chadwickboseman honrando a sua historia. Mas neste filme há mais um sepultamento. Um filme bem produzido com sua cores e fotografia. Mas os produtores fumaram um belo de um basead0, com a estoria de Namor. Namor na estoria de quadrinhos vem de um relacionamento de uma Atlante e ser humano, acho que para não parecer ser a mesma estoria de #Aquaman Colocaram Namor como um índio asteca, maia,...... que foram contaminados com vibranium. Ficaram azuis e metapeixes. Não sei oque comentar. Então aquele Namor dos quadrinhos se tornou um índio voador e peixe. Piada. A nova Pantera Negra é Lititia, todo aquele ritual para o 1º filme, aqui tudo isso foi ignorado e simplesmente ela se transformou. Uma outra gande gafe do filme e quando Lupita que para descer até o habitat de Namor teve de usar um traje especial por causa da pressão que a mataria, mas quando ela salva a princesa, sobe a superfície sem precisar do traje. Roteiro e enredo realmente a traição para estoria do Namor e como o transformaram, foi sim um ultraje. A forma como levado a batalha no navio, foi patético. Uma hora é um Super criatura, mas depois se tornam lutadores irrisórios. Vale apena assistir? Sim, mas desde que não seja tão critico para não se frustar.

The acclaimed director steps up to the seemingly impossible challenge of trying to make a film without its most integral character, but Coogler manages to exceed expectations, crafting a poignant and thoroughly entertaining film. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" draws out stellar performances from its cast and introduces marvel audiences to new threats these beloved characters face. After King T'Challa's death, Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), Shuri (Letitia Wright), and the entire kingdom of Wakanda find themselves mourning their admired leader. But with world powers becoming increasingly frustrated with Wakanada's refusal to share their precious Vibranium, they decide to take matters into their own hands. Their search inadvertently angers Namor, king of an ancient underwater kingdom known as Talokan. Determined to keep his kingdom safe and hidden, Namor asks Wakanda to find the scientist responsible for creating the machine finding the Vibranium. But, as tensions rise between the two nations, will Namor's desire to wage war on the surface world, and keep his kingdom and his people safe, wipe out Wakanda as we know it? Ryan Coogler directs a moving depiction of grief and loss with such tenderness that solidifies him as the perfect man to direct the film. Coogler takes Boseman's absence and builds off of it in such a way that audiences wouldn't think possible, delivering an outstanding sequel to one of last decade's most culturally significant films. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" manages to escape Marvel's curse of mediocre sequels, majorly surpassing films like ""Thor: The Dark World"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". With its ability to juggle its multiple themes and its duality of being an entertaining action flick with a suitable send off for a king, the film is a strong way to end phase four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Angela Bassett reprises her role as Queen Ramonda and delivers a powerful and vivid performance. Bassett flawlessly proves she deserves the Oscar nomination she received for her performance as the Wakandan queen, and quickly asserts herself one of the highlights of the film. Letitia Wright also delivers a fantastic performance, not only does she shine as Shuri, but the BAFTA nominee also brilliantly steps into the role of Black Panther with ease. Both women do a stellar job encompassing their characters' intense grief and emotion Tenoch Huerta makes his MCU debut in the film, bringing the aquatic character of Namor to the screen. The ""Narcos: Mexico"" actor brings the menacing villain to life with an assured performance that allows Namor to be an ominous new threat while also introducing audiences to a whole new part of the Marvel Universe. Huerta's turn as Namor benefits from Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole's impressive worldbuilding when it comes to the underwater world of Talokan. As well as introducing audiences to a new villain, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" also finally brings the character of Riri Williams (a.k.a Ironheart) into the MCU. Dominique Thorne (""If Beale Street Could Talk"") easily slips into the role as the gifted MIT student, injecting energy into the character even if at times her inclusion seems like a bit of a plot device. Much like its 2018 predecessor, the film features stunning cinematography that brilliantly highlights both the intricacies of the costumes as well as the elaborate sets of Wakanda, while also making the film a visual feast for the eyes. Autumn Durald Arkapaw (""Loki"") crafts stunning imagery that rivals the cinematography of the first film, while also escaping the curse of Marvel's bland cinematography. Ludwig Göransson returns to the world of Black Panther with yet another incredible score. Working his magic once again, the Swedish composer, who won an Oscar for his work on the first Black Panther film, composes a score full of the work of talented African and Latin artists alongside grand classical pieces. Like ""Black Panther"", this film is accompanied by a soundtrack comprised of songs specifically written for the film by a myriad of artists from across the globe. Artists like Stormzy, Future, and Rihanna have their songs included in the film, with the latter writing two songs for the film. As well as being technically impressive, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" also ends up managing its complex themes with remarkable ease. Ryan Coogler weaves ideas of loss, grief, family and legacy into the narrative without allowing them to overpower the film, but including them in the film in such a tasteful way. The film is both an affecting send off for a king, and a stellar instalment in the ever-expanding MCU. In typical Marvel fashion, the film does include the standard mid-credit scene but departs from the tradition of using it to set up a future film or introduce a new villain, instead choosing to carry on the legacy of Boseman's character in a heart-warming and unexpected way. Ryan Coogler directs an outstanding film that manages to thoroughly entertain viewers, while also showcasing a fitting send off to Chadwick Boseman. Despite the hefty runtime, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is loaded with intense action and heart-breaking emotion that keeps audiences engaged throughout, and sticks with you long after the credits have rolled.",SHOW MORE,,

He welcomed us to Wakanda. Outside, he remained as his character inspiring others. After ""Endgame"", he stood by Kevin Fiege in formally announcing ""Black Panther II"". Then a year later, he has become one within the Ancestral Plane. He was so great in embracing the role he could not be replaced, no matter if there are potential storylines for T'Challa to explore and grow. He owned the role by bringing him to life, and other portrayals afterwards followed his humane lead. We have seen recasts through the MCU, and they carried the characters well despite still missing the original star, but it is not the same on someone so incredibly definitive and personally close to the role till suddenly gone. The show still went on, for a reason to make him proud rather disappoint nor replace him, and ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" became methodically personal, transcending above the MCU like an evolutionary cinematic piece. Chadwick died of colon cancer, only known by very few people being aware of his silent struggle over his final few years as he tackled projects and roles with 110% effort that finalizes his legacy while checking off some sort of bucket list. This real-life loss was integrated into the revised story. Originally, it was about T'Challa's grip on time after being blipped for five years, dealing with the political climate and his role as a father. Now in the given revision that acts as remembrance, Wakanda grieves over the sudden loss of their king that stirs intervening world powers to obtain their ancestrally cherished resources for their gain. With another nation, hidden from the world, threatening to surface war, Queen Ramonda must protect what is left of her family as Shuri is prolonging her grief, while the Wakandans as a whole strive to embrace this next chapter that would forge a new path for their kingdom. They will stand and fight, chanting T'Challa's call: Wakanda Forever! Already acknowledged out of preparation that this experience will differ without Boseman's outstanding energy, this became a very touching spiritual tribute that finely functions as closure on any sort of grief while somewhat. ""Wakanda Forever"" is not only your typical fashion of exceeding expectations, but it also became more than the MCU. To clarify, the interconnected films are mostly great in their own ways, some riveted only to the minimum four stars with questionable lows, as they embrace cinematic roots adjacent to their vast comic mythology while recognized as comic book adaptations. Only three features he directed priorly, storyteller Ryan Coogler continues expanding his craft from grounded ""Fruitvale Station"" to uplifting revival in ""Creed"" to culturally assimilated ""Black Panther"" whereas more topics are involved and thoroughly debated, further provoking thoughts. This is his fourth feature, ranking equally with the predecessor, and he achieved what any director sought through an artistically astonishing film. Uniquely presented, aesthetically distinctive apart from others, this is about a grieving assortment of well-established characters displaying their true strengths from experiencing losses and finding the courage to move on while protecting their nation from another with history under mirrored morality as counter reflection. Thematic communication in the narrative veins not only discusses grief next to family but also talks about power and sanctuary peace – as well empathetic royalty. These discourses became supportive structures in constructing the script under such thoroughness, they were thoughtfully written then remarkably executed as their own arguments with counterarguments fleshed out developmentally, continuing the politicism and switching around the questioned legacies that defined the first film as T'Challa became king. The wisdom he shared since ""Civil War"" is silently referenced under subtexts. If Boseman was still alive, grief would have been swapped with time as the only difference between the possible original vision and the final result. But then we would not have the emotionally difficult conflict that Shuri faces and how she connects with the film's antihero Namor's humanity through her inner struggle of unwillingness to let go. This is one of the two films' strongest elements since Wakanda is a hidden, invaluable nation that is advanced across technology and intelligence carefully treads unlike most others, till their considerable weakness under elitism when keeping outsiders from setting foot inadvertently open the setting to our reality. Hence how they are thematically driven with pivotal ideas spread out. Another elemental prominence that powers the themes is the emotional drive from the powerful performances, which is another bolstering source in its transcendent. As we explore the characters more, particularly both returning and introduced, they evolve towards newfound strength. Angela Basset as Ramonda is not just a mother, Letitia Wright as Shuri is not just a supportive intelligent sister who can fight, Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia is not just a love interest, Danai Gurira as fierce, traditional warrior Okoye is not just a loyal captain, and Winston Duke as M'Baku is not just a rebellious brawn for connective power. They become more, and the cast embrace their respective transformation, or better to describe it as a chance to explore more of their strengths and how to climb back up. They performed exceptionally, while Wright, Basset and Gurira in particular performed at their best when most charged, while one other performance is a satisfying surprise. Wright is the main star as she has been poised to take over the mantle, with reluctance hindered by grief over self-shame of failing to heal her brother (they bonded like true siblings in real life), held the film up with heightened caliber depicting raw emotions through her character's growth. She still has that humorous charm like everyone else, but this film dims more serious considering the stakes and how they pressure them down from fragility to truism. While Wright's performance is heartrending from the start then as an enjoyable presence till she mustered her resonating inner strength outwardly, her filmic mother figure Basset acknowledges her character is on the same boat and personally amplify it with a mesmerizing performance that solidifies the film's overall powerfulness as an emotional staple capably peaked. Her best scene may have been almost entirely glimpsed in the trailer – rightfully predicted towards her coming accolades, but the whole scene has proper buildup and a tearfully strained start. She was striking down on Gurira over a failed mission, and Gurira's keeps a stoic stance with constant fierceness and humor, but that moment broke her and brought out who she is within as a hefty representation for lined warriors.",SHOW MORE,,

Ryan Coogler logra hacer una secuela a la altura, el inicio es simplemente perfecto, la película es más una despedida a Chadwick Boseman, de ahí se me hizo muy inteligente que el conflicto interno de los protagonistas se base en la perdida, Shuri con T'Challa y Ramonda, y Namor el vengar la memoria de su mamá. El villano a mi me gusto, creo que tiene una buena motivación y cierra muy bien el personaje al final de la cinta, para mi fue de lo mejor. Por otro lado, cada montaje de la película tiene una obra de producción impresionante, cada escena es un deleite visual que junto a una fotografía con tintes naturistas combinada con una banda sonora perfecta, cada soundtrack te introduce en este mundo, Ludwig Göransson una vez mas demuestra su gran talento. Angela Bassett se roba la película, su impecable forma de extenuar sus sentimientos son los que le dan el peso que necesita esta película para funcionar, los actores son los encargados de navegar junto al espectador en los sentimientos de estos personajes, ellos son los que le dan vida a esta película que a diferencia de otras en la saga en esta se explora el lado mas humano de los mismos, sus propias inseguridades y hasta en su egoísmo, cosa que Letitia Wright y Tenoch Huerta hacen a la perfección. Hay aspectos que no me cerraron, ya que tiene cosas que no logran sentirse naturales, como la sobre exposición del conflicto que es muy notorio en las escenas de Valentina y Everett. Por otro lado, el ritmo es bastante lento y la duración de la cinta no acompaña nada, le sobran bastantes escenas con cosas que se podrían haber resuelto en un tiempo mas corto. Los efectos especiales, sobretodo en el aspecto de Black Panther, en el que ya en la anterior película en las escenas de pelea parece un videojuego. El personaje de Shuri esta vez ya convertida en Black Panther no me gusto tanto, me gustaron mas personajes como Okoye, Ramonda, Iron Heart, o M'Baku por ejemplo.
