I’m not surprised at all the critics love it. Good acting and directing. But a little pretentious and self important. A pretty good story which is something the critical darlings don’t often have, so I can see why the audiences liked it. But long and slow. And a big shift in tone at the end. They wanted to wrap it up without just text so did a weird scene.",,,

Much of it was very slow and drawn out. It felt more like a crime series than a movie.

The production design was so accurate, giving the sense that the cameraman had time-traveled right back to those days and filmed real-life events.

One of the standout elements is Leonardo DiCaprio's transformation, achieved through prosthetics that alter his appearance dramatically, giving him a permanent frown reminiscent of Orson Welles. DiCaprio's acting reaches its pinnacle in a heart-wrenching scene where he processes the death of his daughter, delivering a performance that feels raw and genuine. Lily Gladstone, however, emerges as the film's most captivating presence. Her expressive eyes communicate a profound depth, keeping the audience guessing whether her character is aware of the sinister plans around her. Gladstone's portrayal adds an air of mystery and emotional weight to the story. Robert De Niro, as expected, is masterful, bringing a duality to his role as a public figure and a Mafia boss, blending menace with charisma. Supporting performances from Jesse Plemons and Brendan Fraser are equally compelling, with Fraser's physicality adding an intimidating dynamic to the courtroom scenes. Martin Scorsese's direction is exemplary, blending his signature style with historical authenticity. The film seamlessly integrates archival photographs and dynamic sequences, such as a memorable scene mixing rock and Native American music during a discovery of oil. The period setting is brought to life through meticulous attention to detail, from vintage cars to cultural nuances, creating a vivid depiction of 1920s America. The narrative also highlights racial tensions and the early days of the FBI, offering a sobering reflection on the era's complexities. Despite its strengths, the film isn't without flaws. Some editing choices, such as continuity errors and a broken 180-degree rule in a conversation, stand out as distractions. DiCaprio's accent, while period-appropriate, feels slightly forced and occasionally pulls focus from the story. At three hours long, the pacing falters at times, particularly in the early sections, which may lose some viewers' engagement. Emotionally, the death of Gladstone's character’s mother fails to resonate as strongly as intended, which detracts from the film's otherwise powerful emotional core. Additionally, DiCaprio's morally corrupt character may surprise viewers expecting a more traditional hero, ultimately shifting the narrative's emotional center to Gladstone. In conclusion, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is an ambitious film that succeeds in delivering a compelling story with remarkable performances and meticulous craftsmanship. While not without minor shortcomings, its powerful themes, exceptional acting, and Scorsese's visionary direction make it a memorable cinematic experience.",SHOW MORE,,

It is unbelievable that he is still at the top of his game at 80 years old. The acting is great, especially in the case of Lily Gladstone. Her performance makes her an instant legend in my eyes. She was given the opportunity to show a wide range of her talent as Mollie Kyle. Robert De Niro, who is also 80 years old, gave one of his career best performances. Leonardo Dicaprio gave an exceptional performance as well. The cinematography is a thing of beauty! The signature Scorsese camera work is something to behold. The way the camera moves seamlessly through the house at a high rate of speed around the 44 minute mark is vintage Martin Scorsese. Him pulling off that shot with those mirrors on the wall is an impressive feat to say the least. I love Martin's cameo appearance at the end of the film. That entire sequence was a rather creative way to update the audience on the years that followed. Rather than simply using inserts, Mr. Scorsese chose to present the story in the style of a stage play, which was really effective, in my opinion. I love the final shot, which shows the resilience of the Osage people with the use of an elevating bird's eye view shot, showing the modern day tribe, dancing and celebrating, leaving the audience with something in the way of a happy ending. Killers of the Flower Moon is a great, yet dark motion picture that is even better upon a second viewing. I most definitely recommend this film. 95/100",SHOW MORE,,

Firstly, I'm not sure who decided that this story needed to be told from Ernest's perspective, but that person should be ashamed of their decision. The book was more of a murder mystery non-fiction, and if anything it was mostly from the FBI agent's perspective because it was based off his notes in the actual case. Ernest is a reprehensible, spineless tool, and although the movie demonstrates that at times, it very weirdly tries to get us to empathize with him as well. It makes it seem like he was just a man put in this position and things grew out of his control, but he knew from the beginning what the plan was and went along with it anyway. It also just seems like bad storytelling to me to lay out the perpetrators and plan of this murder plot right from the start, and have the audience watch the police/FBI fumble around while we know exactly what happened. This story was poorly written/adapted, and it doesn't matter that Martin Scorsese was the director or that the acting was amazing because none of that is able to fix a bad screenplay.",SHOW MORE,,

Leonardo also plays the ever pliable Ernest well. It’s a long runtime but it never gets dull, I feel the 3 hour plus runtime was justified as it immerses you into the story well. It is a very melancholy film, it’s terrible what some humans will do to one another in the name of greed. A masterpiece of a film that would probably sit in the number 1 spot for films I’ve seen this year.",SHOW MORE,,

This was news to me, but yeah, that really happened. Apparently, something like 60 Osage Indians were murdered over the course of a decade in these schemes, leading the U.S. Government to change laws regarding inheritance of Native American land. Unfortunately, the film is just too damn long. Clocking in at three and a half hours, it takes an interesting premise and just drags it out to the point of being boring. This seems to be an unexpected consequence of the streaming era. In the old days, studios were a lot more demanding with filmmakers when it came to runtime. This ensured they could get as many daily showings in a cinema as possible. With more viewers waiting to stream films, runtime seems to be less important to studios, allowing filmmakers to indulge to the detriment of their own films. Leaving an hour of this one on the cutting room floor would have benefited this film immensely.",SHOW MORE,,

The brutal story of how the Natives were victims of American colonialism and genocide needs to be told. However, I do not think this film did it justice. While it showed how truly awful people can be, well that’s all it shows. Only in the last 5 minutes showed the resilience of Osage people. The rest of the film is them getting gruesomely murdered, swindled, and being bred/married for money and to be ethnically cleansed/killed by their spouses. All the characters were truly one-dimensional with De Niro being as solely heinous and egomaniacal as the devil himself, and DiCaprio being very seemingly stupid and having no redeeming qualities. [SPOILERS AHEAD] … He goes along with and participates without needing much coercion from De Niro. He seemingly never has a moral dilemma to be honest to his wife or at least not POISON her. Sure he acted sweet in front of her while behind her back he was committing evil acts but to me it makes him less likable. Not only is he a murderous thief, he pretends to be a sweet loving husband while killing her family. The gratification of seeing justice to the bad guys is overshadowed by the long run time and unfortunately is not gratifying at all. We see Lily Gladstone’s character finally show some resistance to DiCaprio in the very end, and I like how she just walked away with poise, it was true to her character, but honestly she deserved much more. I cannot believe she didn’t kill him in that field but embraced him. There was no way she did not know he was guilty at that point. Particularly because she was well enough to meet him in the field. I know “rose colored glasses” but he was never that great of a husband and he killed your family and tried to kill you. She knew this I believe, otherwise that would make her very ignorant. She is the ultimate victim who loses truly everything. We only hope her life after this was peaceful, but we don’t know for sure. All we get is a obituary. We don’t know what became of the Osage people or how they fought back. Or how we could support indigenous people today",SHOW MORE,,

If I'm in the middle of saying something and I get interrupted for using a word someone doesn't like, I'm probably going to just quit talking. If a movie is truly worth making, it should not be censored. If it's not worth making...

It's one of his strongest performances with subtle character acting that really shines. Lily Gladstone is stoic and sweet, you instantly care about her character very much which makes the business of her slow, painful death after witnessing the tragic deaths of her family members incredibly engaging and challenging. Any drama with something to say should challenge you. Robert Deniro is also top-form here as a manipulative, power hungry man who puppeteers murders and wipes his hands clean with the callous menace that only an actor of his caliber could convey.

Completely wastes the otherwise fine supporting cast and set design, which is a shame, because Flower Moon is extremely well-made period piece. It is a well-documented film about the Osage people yet it's just three and a half hours of horror to sit through.

The film certainly got more interesting in the back half, but the ultimate payoff was weak. I would have liked to see the villainous characters get what was coming to them. Instead, I got an innovative old-time radio show description of what happened to them. The presentation was interesting, particularly for someone who enjoys listening to old-time radio show podcasts. But as someone else noted, it was effectively a glorified caption. As I sit here now I realize I didn't feel a strong connection to any of the characters, not even Lilly. I simply didn't care.

I kept waiting for it to get better for the entire 3.5 hour runtime but it never did. It definitely has things going for it. The acting is phenomenal - although the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone is very unconvincing and superficial - and the cinematography gorgeous. The subject matter is very important and it's good that it's being brought to attention. Having said that, it's quite simply boring. I love a good slow burner as much as the next man - considering There Will Be Blood to be possibly my favourite movie, for example - but the film does not offer enough substance to merit its runtime. The entire movie rests on the relationship between Leo and Lily and as said before, it's just not convincing. It ultimately crumbles under its own ambition, which is a shame considering the tour de force team behind it, but unlike The Irishman, this is just not the magnificent masterpiece Scorsese tried to conceive. It'll certainly be good and enjoyable for certain people, but I think most people will find it at least 90 minutes too long and devoid of substance.",SHOW MORE,,

Ponderous and slow are the two main adjectives I would use. The first 90 minutes, yes 90, should have been completely redone. Characters would come in have 5 seconds on screen, then die sometime later and you would have no clue who they were or at least why you should care. good acting alone cannot make a good movie. It is a real shame as the story of the Osage people is one that should be told, just in a much better way. And the ending? just horrible, 3.5 hours and no payoff just a glorified caption really.

After reading the book by David Grann, I felt this is the perfect adaption. If i talk about the screenplay, it was a bit longer but tremendous. For the sake of character development,the runtime was a bit longer. Talking about performances, I felt neither de niro nor leo was the show stealer. It was lily gladstone who was amazing and you will fall in love with her. Her expressions and acting was so on point that i felt really engaged with the character.

The story is about a string of murders and how this case helped legitimize the FBI, but there's no whodunnit. They put everything out in front…HERES THE EVIL PEOPLE SOING EVIL! Ok so then I would suppose it's supposed to be a character study, but the movie is so much Deniro and DiCaprio and Deniros character has no nuance as a big baddie, just a run of the mill greedy baron type, no secret underlying motivations, just greed. Meanwhile DiCaprio plays his same old ""young man looking to make a name for himself struggling against a society or system that doesn't quite accept him"" role he's done over and over….plus he basically just wears this same one dumb look on his face the whole movie.

The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone in the leads as Ernest and Mollie Burkhart. The movie also stars Robert De Niro, Brendan Fraser and is directed by the infamous Martin Scorsese. Just like many people going into this movie, I didn't know anything about this true story and these events that took place but the trailer intrigued me enough and after a few tries of watching this 3 and a half hour movie, I can happily say that this movie is what cinema is all about. The performances in this movie are no joke and are some of the best acting from an ensemble in a long time. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Gladstone felt so organic and natural, and when the intense drama took place, they both knew how to perfectly deliver their performances. The atmosphere and cinematography in this movie was beautiful, and the best scenes that showed this was probably the opening, or this one scene with an explosion. But most importantly, the story is incredible. I mean, the amount of detail that was put into this story when showing the different points of views and making sure to tell every aspect of the story with such dedication and thoughtfulness is what makes this movie such a masterpiece. The way Scorsese executes certain scenes with this slow pacing that makes up for it with world-building, and telling the story in a way where it's easy to understand and dissect, while also making it entertaining, suspenseful. emotional, and satisfying with the conclusion to this heartbreaking story, it's really incredible and inspiring to see such a true story be brought to the big screen in such a fantastic way.

""Killers of the Flower Moon"" presents a grim examination of how individuals, driven by greed and cowardice, can commit heinous acts. Ernest Burkhart witnesses his uncle's ruthless killings of the Osage people for their wealth and becomes complicit in these atrocities. As the violence seeps into his own home, he remains indifferent, even contemplating ending his wife's life despite his love for her. Despite its lengthy runtime of three and a half hours, the film maintains tight pacing throughout. While it delves deep into the lives of the Osage people, it also explores the broader circumstances surrounding them, offering a comprehensive view of the events that shaped their lives. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a fully committed portrayal of his character; Ernest embodies both heartlessness and cowardice with chilling authenticity. Robert De Niro, true to form, delivers a stellar performance. Lily Gladstone's portrayal of Mollie stands out as one of the 'daintiest' performances I've witnessed. Despite her character, Mollie, not delivering monologues or extravagant expressions, her gentle demeanor exudes life and commands attention effortlessly. She serves as a brilliant representation of the positive values inherent in her tribe. Martin Scorsese's direction is immersive, and atmospheric, and demands patience from the audience. With meticulous detail, he resurrects a forgotten incident, shedding light on it with painstaking care. While ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" may pose a challenge due to its lengthy runtime, for those willing to weather the storm, it offers a blend of education and entertainment. 8/10",SHOW MORE,,

Like ""The Irishman"" before it, I'm fighting real hard to try and justify the length of this in my head, but it's just a little too long. Interestingly, though, this did feel a bit shorter than that 2019 effort, even with the two being roughly the same length. Could be this one had a livelier wrap-up, but I digress. What a well-realized epic this was. De Niro, DiCaprio, Plemons; all bring their A-game here, but make no mistake -- this was the Lily Gladstone show for me. The amount of strength, poise and stoicism that she brought to this role is so beyond impressive. So cool to see someone previously regarded as an ""under the radar"" indie performer finally getting some mainstream exposure and regard. Hope we'll be seeing her in more things after this. Honestly gotta recommend everyone watch this for the historical significance alone (even if you gotta do so in installments).

Ovviamente di prim'ordine la fotografia e la musica, di altissimo livello e senza mai pecche. La sceneggiatura introduce subito i personaggi e l'inizio della trama, con una fretta non del tutto in linea con il resto del film molto più compassato nei tempi e negli eventi. Storia assolutamente interessante ed unica, che merita di essere raccontata e che viene raccontata con immenso tatto da un lato ma allo stesso tempo con la giusta rappresentazione della ferocia e dell'avidità ""bianca"" dall'altro. Peccato, con il tempo a disposizione, non essersi addentrati meglio nella psicologia dei personaggi; scelta mirata che però viene parzialmente disinnescata da alcuni momenti effettivamente un po' lenti. Finale molto intenso ed emozionante, che rende giustizia al mastodontico racconto.",SHOW MORE,,

Evidently this is a lesson that Martin Scorsese struggles to learn despite his venerable age, because his latest and interminable effort fully demonstrates what happens when a director embarks on the making of a movie without knowing how to manage its running time. Killers of the flower moon takes what would basically be a plot full of events, mysteries and food for thought and barely manages to give the latter away, staging various events stacked together in a manner totally devoid of pathos and sense of progression of the narrative. Many facts and things happen but somehow the more the minutes pass the more it seems that nothing has happened. The movie is simply correct, to the extent that: the acting, the direction, the photography and the staging are correct. However, there is not an acting performance, a scene, a line of dialogue or a shot that is memorable and a movie directed by someone of Scorsese's caliber is unthinkable that it is ""simply correct"". Every aspect of the movie is subdued and if this were to be a consequence of his directorial maturation, perhaps Scorsese should have taken refuge in directing a more intimate movie with a less gargantuan duration since he proves to be totally incapable of knowing how to manage it while keeping the audience's attention high from start to finish. Yet in the same year in which this movie was released we had in Oppenheimer a clear example of how the narration of events so distant in time from us can keep us in suspense for 3 hours. The difference between Killers of the flower moon and Oppenheimer, however, lies in the fact that Nolan did not have the same claim as Scorsese to want to teach new generations of spectators what the ""right"" way of making cinema is, without realizing that times are changed and that the way of making movies has changed. Scorsese's career has suffered no more or less the same decline as those comicbook movies that he did so much to denigrate: it began by entertaining crowds of spectators with countless memorable moments and is concluding with a series of products whose only memorability is linked to their anachronism. Because this too, dear Martin, is cinema and you are part of it.",SHOW MORE,,

First of all this movie is simply put way too long. The story is interesting and flows well, but three and a half hours at the movie theater is just a lot to ask of any movie. Especially one that is very dialogue heavy and lacking direct like intense action. So going into the movie I knew absolutely nothing about this story, nor had I read the book. The story is very intriguing and keeps you engaged the whole time with how crazy it of a concept it truly is. Leo does he usual At work and delivers an epic performance. Himself and Mollie have a dynamic relationship and it really makes you feel for the story and feel there love for each other to make it so deceiving what was actually going on. It was like a murder mystery of the Osage people, but the point of view was from the point of the murderers. It really did feel at times that Leo did not know he was doing anything wrong. It really felt that he loved his wife, and that he thought he was just helping out his uncle. DeNiro plays his role well in his sinister Oklahoma businessman gangster type role. It is a story showing how greed and power can so easily corrupt people. The cinematography is great, and really immerses you in this rural area in such a wild time in American History. I would not say it is Scorsese's fast ball but it is definitely worth the watch. If this movie was even 1 hour shortly, it would have be night and day better. One thing I did not get as well, how were there not subtitles on some of the long native speaking parts. It felt at times entire conversations happened and we knew nothing what was said. Two Hours perfect, two and a half fine, but three and half is just criminal stuff. Official sundaynightstreaming rating of 7.3",SHOW MORE,,

Clocking in at 3 and a half hours, the film's epic scope might test your patience, but it's a narrative that deservedly demands attention. The Osage wealth from oil becomes a sinister backdrop, drawing in a conspiracy of corruption among guardians, judges, lawyers, doctors, and businessmen. While the runtime may feel excessive for a movie, the intricate worldbuilding and classic Scorsese touch make it a visual treat. Lily Gladstone's Oscar-worthy performance as a standout Osage character adds a layer of brilliance, stealing scenes effortlessly. Despite the slow pacing, the evolution into a full-blown mafia drama feels quintessentially Scorsese. De Niro and DiCaprio deliver solid performances, though Gladstone shines brightest. The soundtrack, deserving of its Oscar nomination, complements the immersive experience. The film's second act, albeit a bit sluggish, weaves a captivating narrative. A surprise cameo in the ending adds an extra layer of satisfaction, enhancing the overall impact. While some might argue for a shorter runtime, the engrossing storytelling keeps your eyes glued to the screen. A few casting tweaks could have enhanced the experience, but the film stands tall as a cinematic achievement. Oscars are beckoning, especially for Lily Gladstone, whose exceptional portrayal deserves the spotlight.",SHOW MORE,,

It's true; I had to watch it for two days, but is it a bad thing for me? No. Watching it didn't feel like a chore. That is only possible if it's a gripping story with an even more gripping storytelling and has an equally talented cast. DiCaprio was no surprise, Gladstone rightfully earned all the Best Actress nods for her understated performance and bold presence in all scenes she was in (I have yet to see Poor Things for my final Best Actress pick), and we need more De Niro-Scorsese tandem because they just work so well together.

The movie starts with ww2 vet Ernest coming to an native part of America, he quickly marries a rich girl named Molly that is an heir for many lands with lots of oil in them and so to have the full inheritance Ernest and his uncle William slowly but brutally kill all of Molly sisters while Ernest struggles with the morality of his actions. It certainly is an emotional movie with its main strengths being their two main characters , Ernest remains a routable yet hateable protagonist quickly and effectively making you hate and love him, Molly also is a highlight in this movie giving silent but heartbreaking scenes furthermore the supporting cast of characters are all very entertaining, however the movie suffers for a 3-hour runtime making it feel sometime too slow for it own right.

Like clockwork, names that are sure to be part of that list are Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Leonardo Dicaprio. Oh and hey, wouldn't you know it, Killers of the Flower Moon has all three. So, naturally critics immediately start throwing around words like ""masterpiece"" or ""perfection, "" but does the movie live up to the hype? In a word, no. For starters, this movie is long, I mean REALLY long. While I wouldn't have an issue with the length, if well-paced, this movie was painfully slow. What's worse is I can tell which moments needed to be shaved off. For instance, when I watch a movie, I ask myself, ""why did the director want me to see this shot?"" Sometimes this can be obvious. When they linger on a specific character or object it could be meant as a piece of foreshadowing, predicting events to come. In this case, however, there were so many unnecessary scenes to the plot, that ultimately slowed the pacing to a crawl. Next, is frankly one of my biggest historical movie faux pas. Watch any older video of the time and you'll find the streets, bars or restaurants vacant, 50-100 people tops, even during the busiest of times. Yet, for some reason, certain directors insist on packing scenes full of people, or activities, to visually stimulate the audience. They'll call it authenticity but I call it ""visual noise"" and disingenuous. Lastly, some directors prefer a bare scripts to allow their actors the freedom to ad-lib. This is designed to create a natural, authentic (there's that word again) interactions between actors. Unfortunately, without the proper guidance this can lead to uncomfortable and awkward performances. In this case, I feel the better performances were from some the supporting cast rather than the principles.",SHOW MORE,,

Essentially what this movie is about is oil is found on Osage land and one by one all of the native Americans are murdered for their money, This was everything I expected it would be like and nothing like I expected it would be like all wrapped in one. I think Robert DeNiro actually gives a really good performance. I haven't been so impressed with him as of late so it was good to see him act the way I know he's capable of. Leo has some weird acting choices and accents in it that I didn't really like. I don't know of too many movies where I'm iffy on an acting performance by Leo- and while I respect him for taking a chance- I didn't really think it worked Lily Gladstone really steals the show in this one though. Leo and Robert are big personalities; however, she doesn't simply blend in with them. She commands the screen. This film topped most of the areas I look for when giving a review. The only knock on this film is I don't know it has the value of a rewatch. If you've seen it once, I don't think you'll be going too much out of your way to keep rewatching it. 9.3",SHOW MORE,,

(Hey, when you're snowed in, bring on the 3 hour 26 minute Scorsese movie!) It was... pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. First of all, it's definitely a Scorsese movie. The visuals and technique are of course awesome, which is not surprising at all. The score by Robbie Robertson (RIP) is great... at turns menacing and wistful when it needs to be. And a lot of the performances are great. (DeNiro maybe doesn't nail the accent, but it's still a good ""banality of evil"" performance by him.) I can't really slag DiCaprio anymore, because he's really good in this film. Good supporting performances surround those two. Lily Gladstone definitely needs some award consideration as well for her performance. However... from a screenwriting perspective, I think there's some problems. I haven't read the book yet (I have it in my possession to do so), but I'm betting it's going to be a different perspective than what you see here. I certainly don't think it was an intention of Roth and Scorsese to make the people who were the SUBJECT of the atrocities peripheral to their own story, but unfortunately that's what you kind of get here, despite the director making some valiant attempts to circumvent that. Look, we get it: if your film stars Leo, then the focus is going to be on him, whether it should be or not, but that's the main quibble I have with the film. Small quibble is the length. Yes, yes, ""saving cinema"" and all that, thanks Marty, but ""Goodfellas"" is 2 1/2 hours and is, in my opinion, better than this movie. I'm still recommending it, but as I said, I get a feeling that when I'm finished with the book, I'm definitely going to be in the camp that feels the book is much better than the movie. Which is usually the case, I know, but I'm just curious to see what another director with, shall we say, a different perspective, might have brought to the film. With no disrespect to Mr. S, because I remain a big fan. This is just one of his ""very good"" efforts and not one of his masterpieces, in my opinion.",SHOW MORE,,

She deserves any accolades she will get for this film. Now the rest... What could have/should have been a compelling tale of greed and murder became an overly long exercise in directorial ego. This movie is what happens when no one wants to tell a legendary director that they should let an editor take a crack at the film before releasing the director's cut. An interesting story could have been about the Osage and the agents who tracked down the killers. Instead we get a overly long, muddled focus on the criminals. A focus on King and Ernest might have been okay if (1) we had gotten more of a backstory about the criminals (how did King come to be King?, was Ernest always as dumb as he was during the period covered by the film?) or (2) more exploration of the killings and how people in the community reacted to them (more detail on the impact in the community, who did they suspect was responsible?). It's amazing that in 3.5 hours, so many potentially interesting parts of the story were not told. Instead we get vignettes and glimpses which take the place of exposition. Perhaps tell us more about the KKK than a few seconds of them marching in a parade? How about a bit more detail on the relationship of the Osage killing to the Tulsa massacre? A lot of the press has lauded Scorsese for using Native American actors and Osage dialog. This is commendable, but at this point shouldn't that be taken for granted? Is it really so remarkable that a big budget file would do the right thing? And finally, what's with the radio play at the end? So many interesting pieces of the story are jammed into a jarring conclusion that seemed as though even the director knew this had gone on too long but he needed to tie up loose ends. Many films will end with a list the crimes and sentences in a series of scrolls but Scorsese decides to use a radio play as the delivery mechanism. An interesting look into Foley artists and radio play production to be sure, but is that what was important about the wrapup? The significance of the aftermath of the killings took a back seat to the vanity project of showing how radio plays were created. I had hope for this movie despite it's length. Given the critical acclaim, I figured Scorsese had made an important contribution to our understanding of this suppressed period of our history. I was wrong.",SHOW MORE,,

Porém, uma série de mortes e assassinatos começam a acontecer entre eles. Isto é o pano de fundo para a história de Ernest e Molly Burkhart. Ele, um soldado retornando da Primeira Guerra, buscando fortuna. Ela, uma osage rica com o dinheiro do petróleo. Vendo esse filme, logo uma coisa aflora: para certas pessoas, é inconcebível que pessoas não brancas possam ter dinheiro. Fico pensando que os osages talvez achassem que eles seriam aceitos na sociedade dos brancos com o dinheiro do petróleo, mas isso apenas despertou o pior em muitos brancos. O dinheiro dos osages causou uma inversão: os empregados agora eram os brancos. O quanto isso deve ter pirado os preconceituosos! É nesse caldeirão que Ernest chega para ganhar dinheiro, trabalhando para seu tio. E o primeiro diálogo entre Ernest e o seu tio já demonstra todo o mau-caratismo de William Hale. Complementando, temos Molly Brown. Enquanto Ernest é falador, Hale, uma serpente sempre armando e pronta para dar o bote, Molly observa a tudo. Ela percebe as intenções de Ernest quando ele começa a cortejá-la. Ela tenta ser um apoio para a sua família, começando a ser destroçada, com os casamentos com homens brancos. E Molly tem a serenidade e a austeridade que os seus algozes brancos não têm. E que trio espetacular! Di Caprio, De Niro e Lily Gladstone fornecem interpretações magistrais, que merecem todos os prêmios e indicações que receberam. E Scorsese dá um show de direção, com um roteiro redondo e preciso, uma montagem excepcional, que não permite que o filme torne-se cansativo com suas mais de 3 horas de duração, figurino excelente, direção de arte apuradíssima, uma aula de cinema. E o filme assume várias identidades. É um western a la corrida do ouro. É um filme de gangster, onde o silêncio a todos protege. É um filme policial, investigativo, com os integrantes do iniciante Bureau de Investigação tentando resolver o caso e prender os culpados. É uma denúncia de uma parte da história norte-americana que estava sendo apagada dos livros. E é uma fábula sobre ganância, preconceito, inveja, como somente o cinema e Scorsese podem produzir.",SHOW MORE,,
