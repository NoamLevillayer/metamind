This movie tells the story of a man in the mid to late 1900’s with a disability. He accomplished incredible things through out his life, including fighting in the military, opening a business and receiving many awards. He becomes famous and finds and fights for the love of his life, Jenny. This movie is the perfect example of not judging a book by its cover, as young Forrest was beaten up and mocked as a kid only to achieve more than his bullies ever did. This is an amazing movie, I definitely would recommend it.",SHOW MORE,,

Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is filled with warmth, emotion, and unforgettable moments that make it feel as close to perfect as cinema can get. At the center of it all is Tom Hanks’ legendary performance as Forrest, a man with special needs whose pure heart, determination, and unique perspective allow him to stumble into some of the most iconic events of the 20th century. But what makes this film so powerful isn’t just Forrest’s story—it’s the way the movie introduces and builds the people around him. From Bubba and his dream of a shrimping business, to Jenny and her complicated but heartfelt relationship with Forrest, to Mrs. Gump and her tough-love wisdom, every character feels fully alive. Zemeckis allows us to engage with them, understand them, and ultimately fall in love with them. The writing and storytelling are nothing short of brilliant. The script blends humor, heartbreak, history, and hope seamlessly, creating a film that feels timeless. Iconic lines like “Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get” have become part of our cultural language, but the movie goes far beyond catchphrases. Its military storylines, its portrait of love, its message about perseverance and destiny—it all resonates on a deeply human level. What could have easily come across as offensive or unrealistic—a film centered on a man with special needs—was instead handled with such grace and sincerity that it brought audiences together. Rather than dividing, it united viewers through empathy and love, showing us that innocence and kindness are often stronger than intelligence or power. Nearly three decades later, Forrest Gump still holds up as one of the greatest films ever made. It’s a movie you can rewatch endlessly, and each time it finds a way to move you all over again. Verdict: A masterpiece. If you’ve never seen Forrest Gump, you might as well be living under a rock. This is a film I recommend to everyone, and it will always remain a gold standard in heartfelt storytelling.",SHOW MORE,,

It’s one of those rare films that sticks with you long after the credits roll — funny, emotional, uplifting, and quietly profound all at once. Tom Hanks delivers a performance that’s nothing short of iconic. He completely becomes Forrest, a character so sincere and genuine that you can’t help but root for him every step of the way. The journey he takes — from the football field to the Vietnam War to running across the country — is wild, touching, and deeply human. And after watching it… I couldn't stop making Bubba jokes. 😭 The shrimp scene lives rent-free in my head. It’s hilarious and heartbreaking all at once — a perfect example of how this movie blends comedy and emotion so effortlessly. The film is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving real history into Forrest’s personal tale in such a seamless way. The soundtrack is perfect, the pacing never drags, and by the end, you’ve laughed, cried, and maybe even learned something about life, love, and destiny. “Life is like a box of chocolates…” and this movie is one of the sweetest. 9.8/10.

It’s one of those rare films that sticks with you long after the credits roll — funny, emotional, uplifting, and quietly profound all at once. Tom Hanks delivers a performance that’s nothing short of iconic. He completely becomes Forrest, a character so sincere and genuine that you can’t help but root for him every step of the way. The journey he takes — from the football field to the Vietnam War to running across the country — is wild, touching, and deeply human. And after watching it… I couldn't stop making Bubba jokes. 😭 The shrimp scene lives rent-free in my head. It’s hilarious and heartbreaking all at once — a perfect example of how this movie blends comedy and emotion so effortlessly. The film is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving real history into Forrest’s personal tale in such a seamless way. The soundtrack is perfect, the pacing never drags, and by the end, you’ve laughed, cried, and maybe even learned something about life, love, and destiny. “Life is like a box of chocolates…” and this movie is one of the sweetest. 9.8/10. A true classic that never gets old.",SHOW MORE,,

To me, this movie portrays the message that a person is best defined by the actions they take. The character of Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, symbolizes this message. Hanks is perfect for the Forrest role in this movie and his acting combined with a great soundtrack and beautiful picture makes this such a wonderful movie. I also think that the storyline is very well-written, encapsulating the idea that ordinary (even less than ordinary, in Forrest’s case) people can accomplish and do remarkable things. The character of Forrest is one of my favorite movie characters I have ever watched, and my favorite scene comes when it is revealed how he spent his shrimp earnings. Forrest invested and gave away his millions of dollars, and chose to spend his time cutting grass for free. This specific scene symbolizes the character of Forrest and the movie itself, proving that any person is capable of great things and gratitude. Lastly, this movie has some remarkable quotes. Some of these stuck with me, I will list them below. ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.” I like this quote because it symbolizes the randomness of life that can come to anyone. ""But at night time when there was nothing to do and the house was all empty, I'd always think of Jenny.” I like this quote because it shows that there will always be times of peace and quiet, and what you do with that time can define you as a person. ""My mama always said you've got to put the past behind you before you can move on.” This is just a good life lesson. I’d rate it 9.5/10.",SHOW MORE,,

A Espera de um Milagre, O Resgate do Soldade Ryan, Náufrago, O Terminal, O Código Da Vinci, Prenda-me se For Capaz, Elvis,.... Um filme Espetacular. O filme começa com Gump criança que usa armação para poder andar, considerado com QI abaixo da média, parece que tem autismo, quem sabe se o filme nos dias de hoje seria colocado. E com o inicio das aulas o único amigo(a) é Jenny (Wright) e pelos outros sofrendo bulling. E Jenny se torna seu amor platônico e real, do ínicio ao fim do filme. Onde em todo o filme ela segue seu caminho de loucura. Onde ela quando criança seu pai a molestava, assim crescendo com seus traumas. Mas ela foi a que incentivou Gump no inicio depois as coisas vão acontecendo em sua vida, como um tabuleiro de xadrez. Ela diz para Gump “CORRA” e com este comando ele entra no time de Futebol Americano e na faculdade. Até o dia que se alista no exercito, e la faz amizade com Benjamim (Mykelti) que conta as estoria dos camarões e chama para serem sócio, mas ele acaba morrendo. E Salva Tem. Dan da morte. Após isso ele começa a treinar tênis de mesa sozinho e acaba indo para China e vencendo representando os EUA. Ganhando medalhas do presidente, entrevista ao lado Lenon, até o dia que o exercito o dispensa. Gump vai atrás da promessa dos camarões. Mas nada da certo até o dia que vem o tem. Dan e eles acertam e se tornam milionários e ainda acionista da Maçã. Neste períodos ele encontra com Jenny, mas sempre acaba seguindo seu caminho Hipe, drogas, Rock Hall, até o dia que aparece na sua casa de Gump, que estava lá desde morte da sua mãe. Jenny vai embora novamente até o dia que retorna, mas com uma surpresa pois ela trouxe seu filho Forrest (Osment) e ela com uma doença terminal pela vida que levou. Até quando ela parte, e Gump vive com seu filho que relembra da sua infância. Uma interpretação impecável de Hanks, de Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti. Um elenco que teve muita sinergia. Roteiro e enredo Parabéns, como algo fora do comum, que digo da estoria, se torna um sucesso. Vale apena assistir? Com certeza Nota: 10",SHOW MORE,,

I think I enjoyed it more this time. It's certainly put together well and it's pace never flags, and Tom Hanks, despite the annoying accent, gives a very touching performance. I remember being put-off by what I originally conceived of as the antifeminist message—that Jenny had to love an intellectually and emotionally challenged man or she would die. But this time I felt the message was just more that she was so incredibly damaged from the abuse she suffered as a child that she had no idea how to love a man who was good to her. (I also felt this time that the child clearly did not belong to Forrest, but that she thought the kid would be best of with him so when she found out she was dying, she told that little lie). Anyway, a decent film and did make me tear up a bit. I still think Shawshank was the better movie and should have won all the Oscars.",SHOW MORE,,

Hanks' portrayal of this unlikely American icon lends credulity to his character's extraordinary feats, keeping the unbelievable nature of his exploits closer to fantastical rather than inconceivable. Gump's genuine nature grants us the perfect accents of simple humor and heartwarming emotion, simultaneously ameliorating the audience from over-the-top gags and overly saccharine moments. The iconic soundtrack stretches across decades worth of music's most influential names, though at times can be a little too ""on-the-nose"". The selections could have benefited from a deeper dive into some of the artists' catalogs in certain spots. Understandably, the idea was to capture certain moments in time through music, and in that regard, it does its job perfectly. When infused with Alan Silvestri's epochal score, the film's musical presence becomes another character whose presence we should all appreciate. ""Forrest Gump"" is what every moviegoer should get treated to whenever they step inside a theater, and its rare mastery of storytelling is why it remains one of the 20th century's classics. It should continue to stand the test of time in the minds and hearts of movie lovers.",SHOW MORE,,

Tom Hanks' portrayal of Forrest is nothing short of extraordinary, embodying the character's simplicity with a nuanced grace that tugs at the heartstrings. The film's brilliance lies in its seamless navigation through decades of American history, as witnessed through Forrest's unique lens. From the Vietnam War to the Watergate scandal, each historical chapter serves as a backdrop to the protagonist's unassuming yet impactful journey. It's a poignant reminder that even the simplest among us can leave an indelible mark on the tapestry of time. What truly elevates Forrest Gump is its ability to evoke a spectrum of emotions. Moments of laughter are juxtaposed with scenes that delve into the profundity of life's unpredictability. The iconic line, 'Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get,' encapsulates the film's central theme – the beauty found in embracing the uncertainty of existence. Alan Silvestri's enchanting score complements the narrative, evoking nostalgia and punctuating pivotal moments. The film's visual storytelling, aided by groundbreaking special effects that seamlessly place Forrest in historical footage, adds a layer of authenticity that is both captivating and innovative. Forrest Gump isn't just a movie; it's a timeless exploration of the human spirit.

The Question I feel this poses is while it shows all the life lessons we learn throughout life and is what makes it so relatable is what is it that dictates how we learn those lessons, fate, luck, or something in between?Masterfully acted and edited. This beautifully weaves a Romance, Coming of Age Story, War, and MeloDrama into a sophisticated story that's never unfocused and is its own unique tone that really is one of a kind. The closest I can compare this too is this is like a Hal Ashby film but is 51% Drama and 49% everything else. Tom Hanks (Along with Gary Sisnae) is Masterful in this and is the best thing about this along with so many memorable sets and action pieces. The Special effects are incredible and some of the best out to screen. The music is outstanding as well. This moves at a super fast pace throwing so many different memories of Forrest's life at you but never feeling bloated or over the top. This definitely is sentimental and tender but it doesn't do it because of a lack of substance but because it's very relatable due to it covering so much about life's lessons in such a short period through the eyes of such a likable and relatable character. The only issue I have is its message is clear while being ambiguous. It leaves it up to you decide what life is and at times I wish it would've been a bit more clear about that because it's such a big purposely ambiguous message that can be hard to tangibly grab on too to make sense and decide. It can become hypocritical in the grand scheme if you think about it. But at the end of the day everyone should see this once though and make up their minds for themselves.",SHOW MORE,,

Es una película mágica, que cuenta una historia hermosa de una persona que paso por muchas dificultades en su vida pero que la sigue viviendo al máximo a pesar de todo y hasta logra ser la influencia (con o sin intención) de varias cosas utilizadas en un futuro como la frase ""shit happens"" o la camiseta con una cara sonriente; además de la gran cantidad de celebridades o estrellas que logro conocer debido a su alocada vida. Es una cinta muy entretenida, que pueden parecer varias historias que se conectan con el protagonista, contando como fue su vida desde que era un niño que sufría bullying hasta que es mayor y paso por varias cosas como ir a la guerra, jugar al ping pong, jugar al futbol americano, etc. Además, es un chico que cuenta con algunas personas importantes en su vida, como Jenny, su amigo Bubba, su madre y el teniente Dan; y al final termina perdiendo a gran parte de estas personas. Algo que hay que destacar es el soundtrack de Alan Silvestri, teniendo algunos temas que se volvieron icónicos. Por otro lado, los efectos son excelentes, por ejemplo en las escenas en las que conoce celebridades como a John F. Kennedy o John Lennon, las cuales están muy bien hechas. Por ultimo, las actuaciones son brillantes, principalmente Tom Hanks, quien en mi opinión hace el mejor papel de su carrera; además, tiene buenas actuaciones de Gary Sinise, Sally Field y Robin Wright. En conclusión, una excelente película que creo que todos deberían ver porque cuenta un historia hermosa, mágica, emotiva y entretenida que queda en los corazones de todo el que la vea.

Jenny, who is dying from an STD, asks Forrest if he was scared in Vietnam. Forrest then tells Jenny about the stars in Vietnam, the sunset he saw from the shrimp boat, and the mountain lake from his cross-country run. Forrest even mentions a desert sunrise so stunning that he didn't know ""where heaven stopped and the earth began."" Forrest sees the beauty in everything. He took a question about fear and spun it into poetic gold. This is why we love him. His attitude and childlike wonder towards life represents humanity at its best. Something to aspire to. Based on the novel by Winston Groom, and adapted by the amazing Eric Roth, Forrest Gump is an opus about the power of optimism and how to endure life's pain. Forrest Gump masterfully depicts the hero's journey with amazing plotting and structure. It's a journey I want to take time and time again. Robert Zemeckis is a pro storyteller and crafts each scene with the right amount of humor, nostalgia, intensity, and human emotion. The framing device of Forrest telling his story is perfect. We get to live inside Gump's head and see a heightened version of reality from his mind's eye. It's a dream, fairy tale, magic trick, and memory all in one. Forrest Gump grew up in Greenbow, Alabama during the 1950s. Zemeckis paints Greenbow with Norman Rockwell idealism. Childhood is a time of wonder but Zemeckis doesn't let us live there Scott free. Forrest has to deal with a single mother, a low IQ, leg braces, and bullies. Zemeckis is genuine about the story he's telling. Only a director that earnest can pull off a joke about Mrs. Gump banging the school principle and make it work. All of these characters come from a place of Southern Boomer love and affection. The genius of Forrest Gump is the contrast between Forrest's naive innocence and Jenny's cynical life crisis. We get two opposite journeys in one. Forrest is the vanilla protagonist and audience stand in. He's an ordinary man who experiences the extraordinary. Forrest Gump is wish fulfillment. He's a country boy that sees the world. He's the feather that floats in the wind. Forrest isn't focused on the destination, he's just in love with the journey. His heart may pine for Jenny and Greenbow but Forrest makes the best of where he is. He embraces the now. James Cameron once said that a movie doesn't have to be possible it just has to be probable. The byproduct of Forrest's low IQ and social awkwardness is that he has extreme focus. He can assemble a gun and play ping pong better than anyone. He can run from coast to coast and keep a pace. Forrest pops up in so many historical moments that we half expect him to reveal the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon's resignation. This explanation is enough for the audience. In the army, Forrest finds a second family. Bubba becomes a brother to Forrest. ""I gotta find Bubba"" is the ultimate heartbreaking plea. Lieutenant Dan becomes the mentor and father figure that Forrest needs. Dan is a no nonsense bad ass who challenges Forrest and grows to respect him. There's a scene where Forrest is recuperating at a VA hospital by enjoying ice cream. This moment is interrupted when Forrest receives a stack of ""Return to Sender"" letters that he sent to Jenny. This is classic Zemeckis. He gives you bliss one moment and breaks your heart into a thousand pieces the next. With Zemeckis we never know what we're gonna get. Lieutenant Dan goes through the crazy character development that Forrest doesn't. After getting both his legs amputated, Dan becomes a shell of himself. He's a cigar-chomping drunk with a crisis of faith. He hates that Forrest saved his life. Dan has a lot of reinventing to do. When Forrest buys a shrimp boat, Dan agrees to be his first mate. There's an amazing scene where Forrest and Dan survive a hurricane. When the storm clears, the duo have more shrimp then they know what to do with. Peacefully floating in the water, Dan thanks Forrest for saving his life and then makes his peace with God. Dan gets new legs and a new lease on life. Jenny spends the whole movie running from her demons. She tries to fill the void left by her abusive childhood and only half succeeds. She returns home to Greenbow but she's not ready to stay. She's not done running. Forrest is crushed and the only way he can deal with his pain is to run. He runs for three years and eventually his heart begins to heal. When Forrest sits at the bus stop at the beginning and end he's wearing the old pair of Nikes that Jenny got him. To Forrest, the little things in life are the big things. At the end of Back to Future, Marty is rewarded with a better life. Some people don't like this ending but this is classic Zemeckis optimism. Forrest goes through hell and he gets rewarded for it. This is the hope of the film. We want to believe that every disadvantage contains an equal or more powerful advantage. We want to believe in the spiritual concept that all things work together for the good. When Forrest reunites with Jenny it's the healthiest we've seen her the whole movie. She has finally found peace. At the end, Forrest walks his son to the bus stop and the movie comes full circle. Zemeckis doesn't just wrap a present, he puts a bow on top. 1994 was a great year for film and against distinguished competition Forrest Gump won six Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Screenplay, and a second Oscar for Tom Hanks. Is Forrest Gump really that good? I believe it is. Alan Silvestri composed an amazing score and the film features a remarkable song list from the 1960s and 1970s. Forrest Gump may not be for everyone but it hit me right where I live. Robert Zemeckis and Eric Roth's ode through 20th century America is as sweet as a box of chocolates. And that's all I have to say about that.",SHOW MORE,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/m8ZFDQIb0FaXT8NHdZHQ6SBMfVD,,,"Mar 8, 2022","I've always liked Tom Hanks' acting, and this film was no different; I was happy to watch it, and by this point, I'd seen it three or four times since the performance and story line are so powerful. This film follows a group of talented actors who help to the film's production. To begin with, Tom Hanks gives a very good and unforgettable performance in this film. Tom Hanks' role, Forrest Gump, is a plain and slow-witted country kid. We learn about his life, his everyday sayings that help him get by, and how he casually participates in some of the most major events of the 1960s. it's Simple, yet nice. It's a touch too direct and emotional for my tastes, but it's powerful. It's not profound, but it's rather pleasant if you don't think too hard about it. It's amazing to watch how true historical events are mixed into the storyline and film, and it also adds a brilliant humorous element to the film. It's a beautiful film. due to historical truths and a pleasurable experience It's a beautifully created work of art. for the film's cast members' one-of-a-kind performances It's a fantastic story in which the good guys win. Be open to the ideals of the time period as well as the unique and pleasant sense of humor. If I had to add anything, I would advise people who are easily triggered by historical events to avoid certain parts of the film because historical events are depicted in the film, primarily flashbacks to the beginning that do not come across as kind when it talks about the Ku Klux Klan (Ku Klux Klan), and I would also suggest hiding some scenes from children because there are scenes that suggest a sex event is about to occur. and includes scenes of bulling and battles that may not be suitable for all viewers. However, you must be of mature to comprehend and accept some ideas till then. You'll also need a sense of humor to appreciate Gump's activities. As a result, I would recommend that people watch this film because all of the cast members give outstanding performances. The story above, in my opinion, underlines the most important messages that we should all remember throughout our lives. Instead of focusing on your weaknesses, examine your opportunities. Make the most of what you've got. Always give your best effort, respect others, and be willing to learn from others. This will be a wonderful movie for you if you can dig all of the stuff I described earlier and go with the flow. You must be in the right mood and state of mind to enjoy it because this film will truly fully immerse you.",SHOW MORE,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/WYdF8WIDVFGJf9GIW1T8nfRYHGW,,,"Dec 8, 2021","It's not every day that a movie released will still maintain relevancy nearly three decades later, but Forrest Gump has proven itself to be a timeless movie and a blockbuster of its time. I have watched this movie numerous times and have somewhat of a habit of going back and watching this movie at least once every couple of years. I love the way that Forrest Gump's story is told by Forrest's naivete so that throughout the story we can infer what happened through the imagery and inferences. To those who are on the fence about watching this movie because it looks like it would be dull, I urge you to reconsider. This movie is extremely close to what I would consider being a masterpiece of its time due to the versatility of the scenes, the story that it wistfully guides you through as if you were spectating Forrest Gump's life in real-time, and my favorite part of this movie, the character development. There is not much more that I enjoy in a movie as much as I enjoy seeing a character grow and change throughout a movie whether a character reaches a goal and is a different person because of it or even witnessing a character's descent into madness. This movie's character development had me enthralled with the storytelling skills and development of the characters Jenny, Forrest, and Lieutenant Dan. Jenny's character in this story plays an important role in Forrest's life as a love interest that he is constantly chasing through the bounds of the common trope of unrequited love. In the beginning, Jenny found Forrest as a genuine love interest, but throughout the years she grew distant from him perhaps looking for something more than what she had. We watch Jenny go on these adventures throughout the film as if she were searching for something that she had been missing or dreaming about but she never really seems happy with herself. She has then reunited with Forrest again near the end of the film and it is at that point that she finds out that what she truly missed out on was a comfortable life with Forrest. Tom Hanks performed the role of Forrest Gump exceptionally well to the point of becoming synonymous with him. Forrest does have some character development, but not in the traditional personality changing way that we often see in films and shows. Forrest changes others through his interactions, but he remains the same innocent and kind-hearted man as he was in the beginning. Lieutenant Dan however is a very strong case of character development done right. Upon meeting Lieutenant Dan, he appears to be a goal-orientated man with confidence, but after having a traumatic event happen to him, he feels degraded and cheated from his destiny by Forrest. However, we can witness Lieutenant Dan recuperate from his tragic downfall and come back stronger, and happier than he was before through events orchestrated, albeit accidentally, by Forrest again. Again, this movie is the basis of what I would consider being a perfect example of movies done right with the correct execution of character development. For this reason, Forrest Gump has solidified itself in the rankings of my favorite movies I've watched to date.",SHOW MORE,,

It covers the time period from the ‘50s to the ‘80s, with the titular hero inadvertently immersing himself in Vietnam, Watergate, Chinese diplomacy, and a variety of other scenarios.

Forrest Gump, a film directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring veteran actor Tom Hanks, manages to instill very deep moral values ​​in every scene. The film, which was made in 1994, deserves to be called the best film of all time. The film, based on the novel by Winston Groom, tells the story of a man named Forrest Gump. Forrest who since childhood was considered a stupid child with an IQ of 75 has a unique life story. Having been belittled by everyone, Forrest continued to go forward with a stupid label by others against him. Forrest Gump is an epic film that makes the audience realize that behind the shortcomings there are many advantages in each person. The nature of the main character Forrest Gump can certainly be a good example for everyone. So what kind of traits can we imitate from Forrest Gump's character? 1. Loving Parents We can see how much Forrest Gump loves his mother. In the film he is willing to swim from the ocean and run through the city when he hears the news that his mother, Mrs. Gump is sick. Forrest Gump certainly realized that his mother's struggle could not be reciprocated with anything. The mother who always supports Forrest in the midst of his shortcomings makes Forrest realize that his mother is his hero 2. Always positive and optimistic Although Forrest Gump is known as an idiot character in the film. But his stupidity is not a problem for a Forrest. He keeps going and always thinks positive. Don't complain and always try. In the film, Forrest Gump always shows his positive nature in any situation and in any crisis. Can you copy this? 3. Never give up and be generous Of course, if you have watched the Forrest Gump movie, you will realize how generous the character Forrest Gump is. After he managed to create a shrimp company with the initials of his friend Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. He and Lieutenant Dan, a character frustrated by his disability during the Vietnam war, started a shrimp fishing business. After repeatedly failing to catch shrimp at the beginning of his search for shrimp. Forrest Gump didn't give up. He tried many times and of course failed many times. Until one day his shrimp catch was successful and together with Lieutenant Dan he managed to create the most successful shrimp fishing company in his city. Forrest Gump, who seemed to be a very successful businessman, didn't feel happy.Until finally he handed over his company to Lieutenant Dan and gave his income to the Bubba family, his best friend who had motivated him to start the shrimp fishing company 4. Good promise holder Bubba is a black man whom Forrest met when he joined the military. Forrest and Bubba's relationship is quite unique. It's said that their friends don't seem too close. But this is the other side of the Forrest Gump movie. Bubba, who when he was with Forrest, always talked about the world of shrimp, of course, for many people who listened to him talk about shrimp, it was quite boring. But not with Forrest, he always listened to Bubba talk about shrimp and Bubba's dream that when he finished his military duty he would set up a shrimp company with Forrest. But unlucky, Bubba died on the battlefield. Until it was left Forrest with his promise with Bubba to set up a shrimp fishing company. Instead of burying the promise. Forrest kept his promise to his best friend Bubba by successfully founding a very successful company, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. Forrest's promise and dream with Bubba finally came true 5. Don't forget friends and best friends in any situation The next Forrest Gump trait that you can emulate is that he always helps anyone. You can see it in the film even in critical times when Forrest and his troops are attacked by the enemy. Had separated well with his best friend Bubba and Lieutenant Dan. Forrest did not want to stay silent, he finally returned to the battlefield and saved his friends who were still alive even though they were full of wounds. No exception for Lieutenant Dan who he saved even though he had to lose his leg in the end. Lieutenant Dan, who was frustrated with his disability, was angry with Forrest. But again Forrest did not want to forget the Lieutenant Dan. He accidentally meets Lieutenant Dan who turns into a beggar in a wheelchair. Forrest, who at that time was a hero of his country, certainly felt sorry for Lieutenant Dan. Over time Forrest managed to raise new hope for Lieutenant Dan by getting him to join his shrimp fishing company. Lieutenant Dan joins in until Forrest gladly hands over the company he built to Lieutenant Dan. An extraordinary trait. 6. Faithful in love affairs Not only comedy and motivational elements in the Forrest Gump film. Of course the romance drama between Forrest and Jenny can be a good example for everyone. The single love story between Forrest Gump and Jenny seems to break the audience's heart when they see how loyal Forrest Gump is to Jenny. Although he had been separated several times for a long time and many times Forrest Gump was rejected by Jenny and many times he saw Jenny's bad side. Forrest Gump remained standing faithfully waiting for Jenny. He still loves Jenny with all her flaws. Until finally he and Jenny got married. But the marriage did not last long because Jenny had to leave the world early due to a virus due to her wild life. Forrest Gump must have been very sad, Jenny's long-awaited love finally ended briefly. For Forrest Gump, Jenny was his first and last love. 7. Good father At the end of the story, Forrest Gump who has become a father, gives his best love to his son. He applies the love he gets from his mother who is also a single parent. Without Jenny's presence, Forrest Gump performed his role appropriately to be a good father to his son. This film deserves to be watched and imitated in our daily lives because there are so many valuable messages and moral values ​​that we can follow in this film. This film, which has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards, you must watch this at least once in your life!!!!",SHOW MORE,,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif

As for those who claim the movie glorifies stupidity, the phrase ""Stupid is as stupid does"" has a more honest message, namely that stupidity isn't an inability to think but an unwillingness to. As for the movie's uncomplimentary view of the counterculture, there was plenty of bad as well as good about the 1960's-divisiveness, racial and other hatred, violence, the spread of venereal diseases, etc. But not only the left gets skewered.

The well-written story is rounded out by an amazing cast and a unique story-telling approach. It's got a long runtime, but thankfully, it uses every minute of it effectively and never feels dragging.

Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow but simple man from Alabama takes us through decades of his life, which includes various historical settings but all the while his heart is on Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), a childhood friend. FORREST GUMP was released and quickly became a huge hit and ended up winning many Oscars. Today, for whatever reason, the film seems to be hated by many people because of the movies it beat out. I've never really understood putting too much importance on Oscars or any other award show and I really don't understand why one movie must take a beating just because of what films it beat out. ORDINARY PEOPLE takes a beating because it beat RAGING BULL. Something like DANCES WITH WOLVES takes a beating because it beat GOODFELLAS. Then there's FORREST GUMP that takes a beating because it beat out PULP FICTION or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. As far as the film itself goes I think this is a great one. I've always liked how the film took a look at a simple person's life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they've entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it's always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture. I thought the story itself was quite great and especially how we take a look at American history through the 60s, 70s and 80s. I know some people make this a political movie but I've always found that to be rather foolish. The film has a wonderful soundtrack to highlight the various eras that are shown and we also get some clever use of CGI to put Gump in the presence of people like JFK and Richard Nixon. The screenplay hits all the right notes and there's no question that technically speaking the film is impressive. Then there are the performances that really make the movie. Hanks picked up his second Best Actor award and while I personally would have given it to Paul Newman for his performance in NOBODY'S FOOL, there's no question that Hanks is great here. He certainly nailed that ""simple"" man and there's not a false moment in the performance. Gary Sinise is wonderful in his role as is Mykelti Williamson in his small bit. Robin Wright Penn is the perfect opposite to Hank's character and Sally Field is good as well. No matter what people say, FORREST GUMP is still a wonderful little gem that has a lot of great things in it.",SHOW MORE,,

'Forrest Gump' has become, and remains, almost a household name since this film's release decades ago. It's odd too, since Forrest is a simpleton with no real agenda of his own. His character's only point is to present a fresh lens on America circa 1955-1982. He experiences way more of key points in history and culture than anyone possibly could, and then calls them out for what they are. American Boomer culture is actually the main character here.

It was certainly long, probably even too long as some of the scenes of him being a part of history seemed unnecessary and poorly done like the Black Panther thing, but this was such a cultural phenomenon that I was certainly lacking as a well-rounded person for having avoided it for so long. I was surprised by a lot of things, most notably Tom's very narrow head. I watched this after seeing the Back to the Future series & recognized some Zemeckis characteristics in the way the narrative was framed, what with the bootstrapping protagonist. I don't think Sinise deserved an Oscar nomination for his role, though Hanks absolutely did; the decision to pile all of the negative characterization in the movie onto the girl who simply didn't love the protagonist back seemed heavy-handed and rather bizarre, as they portray her as his only real problem his entire life by showing him going through everything else without any true difficulty as they used the narration to provide his rationale for decisions to do things like rescuing his friends in the war. The narrating was obviously very good with the southern accent and the jokes, but it really was excessive as they couldn't make it through a single scene without it. Plenty of other movies use the framing of the character re-telling the story to someone else, but having so few scenes without it made the movie almost into an audiobook where you could close your eyes and never lose track of the plot. I also expected a bit more from the Oscar-nominated special effects as the historical footage had lip flap problems that relatively amateur anime dubs of the same era were conquering. Still strong viewing material, and clearly an excellent production.",SHOW MORE,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/m8ZFDaHb0Faks8NHdkFQbsBMfVm,,,"Jul 23, 2020","Forrest Gump is one of those feel-good Hollywood movies that grows on people within age. Based on a novel, the film follows the life of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a mentally-handicapped savant from Greenbow, Alabama who rides through waves of the second half of the 20th Century: meeting Elvis Presley, joining the University of Alabama's football team, meeting Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, enlisting in Vietnam, joining the ping-pong tournament, fishing for shrimp, and even jogging across the United States. During which he starts an on-again off-again relationship with Jenny (Robin Wright) and they have a child, get married and she dies of AIDS. While not without its sappy and corny moments, the film has plenty of heart in all the right places. The best parts are Hanks's performance and his epic 30-year journey edited with him in present-day sitting on a bench talking to random passengers. It's so mesmerizing hearing his Southern accent as he tells his story and it makes you want to listen to him even more. The worst parts involve Jenny, who I believe takes advantage of Forrest and leaves him in the dust to pose for Playboy, snort cocaine, and join the Black Panther party. She doesn't even notice the fact that he traveled from one country to another just to see her again. On top of that, Jenny is probably the least interesting character in the movie as she holds accountable for its sugary syrupy moments and cliched lines. Despite my complaints, Forrest Gump is still a great all-American breakfast with just the right amount of eggs, bacon and short stacks.

We see Forrest from a young boy, a college footballer, in the army, a shrimp captain before becoming a figure for many.

Watching Hanks as he talks to Jenny at her grave is very emotional as is his sadness over many in Vietnam including Bubba. The film has many funny moments as well as using songs of the era really well. Robert Zemekis has directed the film using great visual effects and CGI enabling Forrest to appear with many key figures including presidents and John Lennon. The scenes in Vietnam with the gun fire and explosions give a sense that you are there. The running scenes with the many spectacular scenes of America is a great love letter to its beauty.

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/QD6F6mum1u0wcpDivahXrFL0u6J,,,"Jun 7, 2020","""Forrest Gump"" is one of the most touching, funny and simultaneously violent films in the history of mankind. Perhaps because of such an unusual cocktail, this film has been constantly in the top three of my favorite films for years, and I can't immediately remember another such film. ""Forrest Gump"" is a masterpiece of world cinema, this truth does not need to be proved, just look at the rating of the film on the Kinopoisk website with a record number of votes, just read the opinions of the audience of the film, where everyone gives the film the highest score, admiring this film or just a phrase from the film. A film that can inspire people with just one phrase is worth a lot, and when there are several of these phrases, and when the hero of the film can inspire with one of his actions… Forrest Gump is a naive fellow, a man who lives for others, a true hero, a Saint who came down to earth to do good deeds… But no, as a person, he also faces ""logical life finales"", tragedies happen in the life of such a good simpleton, and that seems a big injustice. Therefore, Forrest gam is a very violent film, there is not much death on the screen, it is shown without too much pathos, but every time these moments touch to the heart. ""Forrest Gump"" is the only film where, always knowing what will happen next, you want a different development of events, because such a good film should give good, and it is forced to descend from heaven, proving that any dream is limited by some earthly framework and there will never be anything unreal, everything in this life is logical and everything ends sometime.",SHOW MORE,,

Tom Hanks's performance is stunning and a joy to watch. He plays the role perfectly. There are no faults in the way he played Forrest. The film also has an amazing plot and message. For Forrest to not only have survived polio, but also to be most likely (even though not mentioned in the film) on the autism spectrum or to have autism, shows how anyone can do anything. The heartfelt story also had amazing little tie-ins to the time period, like how Forrest inspired Elvis's dancing, or how Forrest called in The Watergate Scandal. I actually laughed at the later moment, finding it very amusing. Also including moments and groups, such as the Vietnam War, The Black Panther Party, The War Hawks and Peace Dove, and the multiple assassinations/assassination attempts were so important to add as they helped define the period, were seamlessly added into the plot. Also the moments of Forrest, not realizing the severity of the situation he is in, but just wanting help someone, are very heart warming and show how we must all treat each other with respect. For example: When he picks up the African-American student's notebook and hands it to here, not caring about what could happen, or knowing about the situation that was really going on. Or when he goes back and saves the men, even when he is looking for Bubba and could die in the line of fire, especially Lieutenant Dan. There are only two moments I find fault with (even those are minor and have reasoning behind them). One: When Jenny leaves Forrest the last time, it was confusing onto why she left him again?. But it is in her character to run away and not confront her problems, until she does at the very end asking Forrest Gump to marry her, giving her an arc. and Two: How his boat, Jenny, made it full circle without a driver and crashed into the dock? It makes no sense, even if you factor in current and wind. But the moment is funny, especially how Hanks causally delivers the lines that follow, so it is fine. Anyone who is breathing has to see this before they die, or they will regret.",SHOW MORE,,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/yrXFY9IjPuK9IzRsPlHq0FAGSjO,,,"May 7, 2020","Forrest Gump (1994) is a movie that follows a man, Forrest Gump, with a low IQ who keeps accidentally finding himself in many important and historical moments. This movie is full of intertextuality with real life, such as the Vietnam War, The Black Panther Party, and the Ping Pong diplomacy. I believe that the intertextualities in this movie help the director present the movie's political stance. A movie's political stance is the thoughts that the movie tries to instill in people's minds to either teach them something or make them act a certain way. In order for a movie to have a political stance, it needs to have an ideological position – a system of beliefs. The politics and ideology of Forrest Gump are ones that advocate for simplicity and patience. Through the form and content – where the form is the way the movie is shot and content is the dialogue – one can notice that the movie is saying that leading a simple life, being an honest person, and not complicating things like Forrest, can lead you to accomplishing great things. The movie's political stance is not one that can be noticed easily since it relies on macro narratives, where the audience need to look at the bigger picture and link all the events of the movie together to understand what idea the movie trying to spread. It feels like the movie itself was conscious of its themes of simplicity, but Forrest was not. Forrest was often unaware of the importance of the events happening around him such as the Hippie movement or being dragged into the Black Panther Party, however, everyone else around him was. Jenny, Forrest's love interest and his first ever friend, was aware that the successes he reached to, such as being awarded the Medal of Honor and being really rich due to his shrimp business, was due to the fact that he was an honest man who always did the right thing. Forrest's patience for Jenny to love him back ended up in them starting a family. Just like any other movie, Forrest Gump relies on elements such as irony, foreshadowing, and architecture to present its plot and political stance. I found it ironic how when Forrest started telling his story to people, he explained the origins of his name to a black woman. This is ironic because he was named after his ancestor, the founder of the The Klu Klux Klan, a hate group that targeted African Americans and supported slavery. The irony of this scene, however, sets the floor for the political stance to start forming, since Forrest thinks in the simplest way to the point where he did not realize that it is probably not a good idea to tell an African American woman that he was related to the founder of the KKK. Forrest Gump relies heavily on foreshadowing. It was foreshadowed that Forrest and Jenny would eventually end up together from the beginning of the movie when Jenny and Forrest were sitting together on a tree branch and then Jenny holds his hand and tells him to stay with her a little longer. When Jenny and Forrest went to different universities, Forrest would visit her in her university. One time, Forrest saw her in a car with another man and they were engaged in a sexual interaction however it seemed to hurt Jenny. Forrest stepped in and pulled the man away from her even though he could have ended up in a fight with the man. This scene foreshadowed two important things, first, Jenny would end up in a lot of abusive relationships, and second, Forrest will always be loyal and protective of her no matter how much it would hurt him. Moreover, the movie also relies on referencing itself in order to foreshadow upcoming events. This can be seen in the scene when Forrest rides the bus on his way to the army and no one would let him sit next to them except for Bubba. The movie is refencing itself because a similar scene happened in the beginning of the movie when Forrest rode the bus on his way to school and only Jenny would let him sit next to her. This self-referencing foreshadowed that Forrest and Bubba were to be best friends and that Forrest would remain loyal to him. Moreover, the movie uses its architecture to foreshadow and build up its political stance. The architecture of a movie consists of the buildings and the lighting of the movie – in other words, it is the design of the movie's environment. Forrest and his mother live in a big house in the rural Alabama. Rural areas are characterized by simplicity and honesty. Forrest living in a simple environment foreshadows that Forrest himself will grow up to be a simple man. Since children are the product of their environment, and the accomplishments of one are a product of who they are, then the environment you grew up in causes your accomplishments. Forrest living in a rural area helps the movie's political stance because all of Forrest's accomplishments are due to simplicity. Forrest Gump is a brilliant movie that uses many aspects of films and links them together in a unique way to present its political stance. The political stance of Forrest Gump is leading a simple life and having patience can lead you to accomplishing great things. The movie presents its politics through the use of irony, foreshadowing and architecture. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend others to watch it.",SHOW MORE,,

""Forrest Gump"" is just an epic movie that touches people throughout all ages and generations. The simplicity of this film is the main reason to love it. This is a movie of a heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace. There's talk of another Oscar for Tom Hanks.In a college dorm with Jenny, who lets him touch her breast, the virginal Forrest ejaculates instantly, losing her interest and his self-respect. In the Army, Forrest saves his captain (Gary Sinise), whose legs are later amputated, and the captain resents him. Forrest is everything we admire in the American character - honest, brave, loyal - and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stay around him for long. Zemeckis doesn't fall into the trap of using Forrest as an ad for arrested development. He knows the limits of a holy fool who can't understand the hypocrisy of postwar America that this picaresque epic so powerfully reveals. The peace-love pretensions of the '60s are skewered as neatly as the greed decades that follow. But there is something of Forrest that Zemeckis would like to see rub off on us: his capacity for hope. It's an ambitious goal in this age of rampant cynicism. Godspeed.",SHOW MORE,,

There's Forrest Gump who's played by Tom Hanks with an IQ right below average. But his mom let's Forrest know that there's nothing that can hold him back. He's is made fun of in school and no one will let him sit next to them on the bus. He has to wear leg braces, has a crooked back, and does not have too many friends. One girl, Jenny tells him he can sit with heron the bus. Jenny ends up being Forrest's best friend and crush. Unfortunately, for Jenny we find out her and her sisters are being sexually abused by their father. Jenny ends up with a lifetime of drug and alcohol abuse that unfortunately costs her life. One day, Forrest and Jenny are walking to school and there are some mean kids calling Forrest stupid and throwing rocks at him. Jenny yells to Forrest ""Run Forrest, Run!""and he breaks the braces off of his legs and runs incredibly fast. Throughout the movie Forrest meets many celebrities, including: Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, President Johnson, President Nixon, and John Lennon. Although, the best people he meets along the way are Bubba and Lieutenant Dan , his Vietnam war friends, Bubba wants to own a great shrimp boat one day. Bubba is similar to Forrest, he also has a learning disability. Unfortunately in the Vietnam War, Bubba dies, and Lieutenant Dan loses his leg in a huge attack. Forrest was saving soldiers including Lieutenant Dan from running in and out of the battlefield. For his bravery, Forrest ends up receiving a medal of honor. Down the line, Forrest ends up saving Lieutenant Dan again. He finds him in New York, a depressed alcoholic. From there Forrest and Lieutenant Dan go on to pursue Bubba's dream and establish the Bubba Gump shrimp boat in honor of Bubba. The shrimp boat ends up being a huge success for Forrest and Lieutenant Dan. It ends up making them a whole lot of money. Lieutenant Dan's depression goes away and he gets himself a fresh new pair of prosthetic legs. Towards the end of the movie, Jenny comes back into Forrest's life. She realizes she is not well and is dying and comes to tell Forrest that they had a kid together. Forrest takes care of Jenny up until her last day. From then on out, it's just Forrest and his son Forrest Jr. At the very end of the movie, Forrest forgets about everything and just runs, very very far. Until he gets aged features on his face and a huge beard. In my opinion, the movie Forrest Gump is a must watch and has a very empowering theme to it. From the famous lines in the movie to the humorous and emotionally powerful scenes, it's an overall iconic and legendary film. The reason I liked this movie the most is the meaning of the movie, at least what I got out of watching it, is to never give up!",SHOW MORE,,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/WYdF8WID9uGOI9AHW6s8riR8iGn,,,"Apr 30, 2020","On July 6, 1994, Paramount unveiled Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump in theaters. The Tom Hanks satire would go on to win six Oscars at the 67th Academy Awards, including best picture. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below: Forrest Gump is not stupid. Although his IQ is 75, he sees the world far clearer than most. Through his decent, childlike eyes, we too see things in a less confused and muddled way. In this cheerfully straight-arrow moral tale, Tom Hanks stars as the ""wise fool"" Forrest Gump and delivers yet another Oscar-level performance. Paramount will win sensational box office with this Robert Zemeckis-directed film. Raised in the '50s in rural Alabama by a single mother (Sally Field), Forrest, being ""different,"" must fend for himself, struggling against not only perceived expectations but boyhood bullies. He unwittingly finds that he's blessed with a talent — he can run like the wind, which wins him a football scholarship to play for Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama. And there's no stopping him after that. An uplifting saga about one young boy's earnest and good-natured attempts to overcome his disabilities, Forrest Gump is also a cheeky social satire of the past 40 years of U.S. social-political history. Eric Roth's screenplay, adapted from Winston Groom's novel, nimbly intertwines Forrest's life with the seminal social events and players of the past several decades. Unassuming Forrest, with his golly-gee enthusiasm and inbred decency, encounters the likes of Elvis, George Wallace, presidents Kennedy through Nixon, Dick Cavett, John Lennon and Abbie Hoffman as he graduates from 'Bama, fights in Vietnam, competes in international ping-pong, founds a shrimping company, engages in philanthropy and jogs cross-country. Contrasting Forrest's unassuming innocence with the upheavals and rancor of the times, the film is a wisely goofy commentary on the stupidity of smartness. While Forrest's foray's into the dens of the big and powerful are cheekily amusing, the film ambles along over a deeper, darker layer: Forrest's love for his childhood girlfriend, Jenny (Robin Wright). An abused child, Jenny's life path is a desperate wander to find solid ground. She falls prey to every social movement and fad of the times; unlike Forrest, whose unwavering strength and sense of right and wrong protect him from being caught up in social slides, Jenny's genuflections reflect her lack of firm values and inner confidence. To some extent, one could argue that Jenny symbolizes most of us. If any criticism might be leveled at the film, it is that its most heart-wrenching moments are too adeptly skirted, but, then again, that's in keeping with Forrest's strength. Highest praise to Zemeckis, who has reached a higher maturity plane with his gracefully, technically eloquent direction. Carrying his torso in an erect, straight-arched manner, Hanks' body language is all-telling. With each strange or perplexing situation, Hanks erupts with the smallest twitch or turn, signaling Forrest's deep-seated disapproval or, in special other cases, his gleeful, thankful wonderment. Mykelti Williamson, as Forrest's simple-minded G.I. buddy, is also outstanding, while Gary Sinise is sympathetic as Forrest's bitter platoon leader, legless after the Vietnam War.",SHOW MORE,,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif

But than a childish, not stupid, man teaches me a way lot more. The vitality of Forrest amazed me. When life punched him in the face (why you so cruel, Jenny?) he just kept on going. Easy answer, yes. But hard to do. ""The world will never starve for want of wonders; but only for want of wonder."" Chesterton said that also. Great guy. He would love Forrest, probably. Forrest wasn't a compulsive athlete of some kind. He also look at the beauty of the world, when it almost couldn't be seen. When cruel Jenny asked him how was Vietnam, he didn't talk about violence and blood, but about the sky at night. Instead of thinking about the meaning of life, Forrest says us to do something about it. If you think too much you'll end up like a self-indulgent Lieutanant Dan. Love your momma. Go to war.

Just an amazing performance by Tom Hanks as he portrays a simple-minded man as he goes through many important historical events. I couldn't see Forrest be portrayed by anybody else. This movie is extremely well written and directed with a great score by Hans Zimmer. Extremely heartfelt and funny and the film will leave you with tears in your eyes as the credits come up onto the screen. This is an absolute must-see!!!,SHOW MORE,,
