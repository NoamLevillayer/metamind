It is compelling viewing but very difficult to watch. I found the ending totally enthralling and upsetting as well as disturbing. It is serious from beginning to end with no room for comedy or anything even remotely light-hearted. Be warned that this is compelling and powerful viewing. Not that I have experienced it but I found this a scarily realistic descent from drug-joy to drug-hell. Can’t say I’ll ever watch it again though.,SHOW MORE,,

Following the characters you see how drug problems lead to the titular death of their dreams. Don't go into this movie hoping for likable characters overcoming trials and making the world a better place. This movie showcases people at their absolute worst and highlights how bad things can get. The best attribute of the film is the editing and cinematography. Aronofsky knows how to inject a scene with energy and make this film a tight 100-minute runtime with no excess filler. Overall, beautiful camera shots, ugly needle shots.",SHOW MORE,,

Such a fantastic film showcasing the dangers of addiction and drugs as well as the corruption in our hospitals and prisons. The main characters are all struggling with a different form of addiction; Sara has an addiction to diet pills and struggles with being an outcast with her neighbors and son. Harry struggles with needles and pushes himself to the brink to help his girlfriend and his mother. Ty struggles with an addiction to powder and the struggles with being a young black man living in a poor financial situation. Marion gets addicted to the same powder and ends up not being able to live without it and turns to affairs after her parents neglect her needs and replace it with monetary love. It really plays with your heart and the difficulties of drugs and money— this movie will drive you to tears.,SHOW MORE,,

The lady that played Sara Goldfarb gave a magnificent (and I’m not using that term lightly) performance. During her scenes I felt disturbed in a way that could only be described as… cringe? But it wasn’t cringe it was just shocking. Only Saving Private Ryan has gotten that kind of reaction out of me before I saw this. So that tells me I need to rewatch this film some time soon, I think I’ll really enjoy it. Seeing Marlon Wayans in a movie other than scary movie (or just a comedy in general) made me laugh.

One of the first things you notice is the creative tour de france of editing techniques. While this is jumpy with no one characer dominating the others, it never feels unfocused, bloated, meandering, or obnoxious with more style than substance. In fact it's got both. The editing really compliments the pacing perfectly and compensates for so many different storylines. It's a very rare case where the editing really makes this work. It uses music video techniques but unlike a lot of others around this time that try that, it doesn't feel dated at all. It comes off as surreal more than anything and really fits with the subject matter. The acting is first rate and really builds as this progresses to the climatic consequences of all the characters actions. Ellen Burstyn is amazing and is the best of all fo them. Even though her story is arguably the most isolated of all four it's not any less fasinating and a real testament to ehr acting ability. It's brutal to watch and fasinating. Shot in a masterfully surreal way that again never feels showy but really amplifies the dazed and confused atmosphere of the subject matter. It's like a comprehensive Apocalypse Now for drug addiction on all sides of the trade. Everyone who has a strong stomach should give this a try once.

Sara Goldfarb's (Ellen Burstyn) universe exists primarily within her Brooklyn apartment where, fueled by amphetamines, she obsesses about appearing on television. Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto), accompanied by his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans), spend their days looking to score their next fix of heroin. It is a nightmarish vision from the start as the characters slowly but inevitably descend into a world of horrifying physical and mental pain, psychosis, surreal hallucinations, and the reality that there is no escape.

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/nx2FDwIpbFGDHwOTaGHoVhd2IAZ,,,"Mar 16, 2021","""Requiem for a Dream"" is an American psychological drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky in 2000. It is adapted from Hubert Selby Jr. in 1978. The film describes four characters affected by drug addiction and how it changes their physical and emotional states. Their addiction makes them imprisoned in a world of fantasy and despair. As the movie develops, each character will deteriorate and their reality will be replaced by fantasy, leading to disaster. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie of four Americans who have fallen from power. They have no bright future but resort to stimulants. When Sara hoped to find a way out of chemical happiness, for her son Harry, his girlfriend Marian and friend Tyrone, she also got used too the pills and even mother Sara Goldfarb fell into a downward spiral. At the beginning of the film, she still tried to guide the child on the right path by tying the TV he wanted to sell to the radiator, but when a rogue nutritionist confessed to a somewhat neurotic sixty-year-old that she might lose weight, because of the pills she didn't want to stop taking them and got addicted. The movie focuses on the lives of the residents of Coney Island, and the film shows the consequences of addiction and obsession and how obsession leads to addiction. By playing with different camera angles and the smooth editing work, a special film experience is created. Just like the audience has experienced the pain of various characters. Jared Leto convincingly plays the role of drug addict Harry Goldfarb, and he will do his best to get the last batch of heroin. But money is a problem. He has no choice but to force his addict girlfriend Marion into prostitution, and the latter is a brilliant role played by Jennifer Connelly. His good friend Tyrone, played by Marlon Wayans, also tried to control his addiction, but his efforts were in vain. When friends were struggling with addiction, Harry's mother Sara was glued to the tube when she called for contestants on her favorite TV show. She is determined to participate, but needs to lose a few pounds to wear her favorite clothes. Her obsession with television made her addicted to drugs that can speed up the weight loss process. But the result was disastrous, and Sara slowly and surely seemed to lose control of reality. The exorcist actress Ellen Burstyn played a very good role. ""Requiem for a Dream'' is a drama film that makes you think, but also gives you a bad feeling. The film clearly shows how strong an addiction can be. But also how strong an obsession can be and that this can lead to rash choices with disastrous consequences. Requiem for a Dream is, for me, the example of a good film that I never need to see again. It made me quite depressed. With this masterpiece, he impressed me as a viewer.",SHOW MORE,,

The editing, cinematography, and filming style is just amazing and innovative. The way he brings to life four different character arcs such that we care about each and everyone of them shows an artist who is a master at his craft. For some reason I didn't have the passionate reaction to this as the many fans/critics that absolutely adore the movie. This may be a generational issue. Trainspotting was more to my personal liking which I think has to do with the soundtrack which for me really elevated it to a more re-watchable film.

Might not be everyone's taste but it's a creative example of a filmmakers vision. The 1978 novel was grimly forensic in detailing the physical and mental destruction wrought by drug addiction. The movie also has one of the most memorable scores ever. Wonderful performances and such bleak imagery are impressive. Good cutting edge indie filmmaking with its split screen style and extreme closeups. It says we're all vulnerable to some manner of addiction, and legal ones aren't necessarily safer or less ruinous than their underworld counterparts. The movie vividly evokes the sensation of what drugs actually do to your system, briefly for better and mostly for worse, from twitchy initial rush through to comedown and tortured aftermath.

Every cast member does a strong turn, but she is the unparalleled standout, accompanied by a major surprise in the form of an unexpectedly good performance from Wayans (who I was unaware had performed in any serious dramas at all). The film's notorious intensity was definitely a driving factor preventing me from seeing this film at some point in the previous two decades, but now having seen it I would describe the film more as exceptionally uncomfortable than unpalatable, gradually building up pressure before ultimately allowing the pot to boil over (characteristic of Aronofsky). The film's take on psychological surrealism and induced delusion is great; parents, don't rely on McGruff the Crime Dog to tell your kids not to do drugs, just show them Requiem for a Dream. (4/5)",SHOW MORE,,
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/GPgF09HKlueji8eswdHMXFKYHeP,,,"Jun 15, 2020","Requiem for a dream is written and directed by Darren Aronofsky based on the book with the same name written by Hurbert Shelby Jr. This film is the story about 4 individual lives and their addictions. One of them played by Ellen Burstyn gets addicted to diet pills when she is invited on a game show and must slim down in order to fit into a dress she so desperately wants to wear and also to look good. Her son played by Jared Leto who is addicted to a lot of things mainly heroine starts up a business with his girlfriend played by Jennifer Connelly and his best friend played by Marlon Wayans where they get drugs and sell it to make profit. And as the year for each individual drug induced person goes on things start getting worse and worse as the drugs take over their health and life. Requiem for a Dream is one of those films that will never escape me and for whoever watches the film I guarantee that it won't leave the mind as well. Through this entire runtime my eyes were glued to the screen for beginning, middle and end. Once in a while I'd think to myself man I am really invested in this film. This film garners your attention and never lets up. Which is an aspect that I think people might not like but we'll get to that in a little bit. From the incredible pacing I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and never found myself attention-less. Requiem for a Dream is an phenomenal piece of cinema that will go down in film history as possibly one if not the nightmarish and disturbing films ever created. And it is by far one of the best films that I have ever seen. Now that might seem very daunting because of the subject matter of the film but I don't know. Not thinking about that subject matter there's something very intriguing about this film that I can't not stop thinking about. Darren Aronofsky has crafted such a unique and creative tale of misery and sadness that in a way just seems so perfect. The way the story is told and how the editing plays a major part of the film from editor Jay Rabinowitz. Including the shots and cinematography from director Darren Aronofsky and cinematography Matthew Libatique giving the atmosphere of the film its claustrophobic and disturbing experience. From the nightmarish scenes involving their hallucinations to the drugs they take to moments of consequences they have to endear. Also trying not to forget to mention but the fantastic and nerve racking score from Clint Mansell giving the film another bump of adrenaline and absolute menace. This might be my favorite Darren Aronofsky film ever and to be far I haven't seen all of his films yet but man I don't think with an experience like this one will be beaten by any of his other films to tell the truth. He did an amazing job at directing this including writing this. It's very unpredictable there was even a moment in the film after I was halfway through it that I decided I can't predict anything out of this film which is something that I really enjoy from a film. You also get why they do this, they're not just stereotypical junkies, they have motives and reasons why they do the drugs. Which leave me to the performances from our 4 main characters. Right off the bat I'm debating if I like Jared Leto more in this or in Dallas Buyers Club. He was terrific in this film. Jennifer Connelly is an actress I'd like to watch more of because man she was also fantastic in this film as the girlfriend of Jared Leto's character. Marlon Wayans as Jared Leto's best friend was also really great in the film which I didn't expect at all but he did really well. But my favorite performance throughout this film was Ellen Burstyn. Out of all of them I felt more for her than anyone. But not to say that I didn't really feel bad for anyone else, I most certainly felt bad for everyone but Ellen's performance I felt just more sympathetic for. From the beginning and end you can see the drastic change in her after going to far with the drugs she takes which was just heart breaking. There's also one scene where I just thought this is by far one of the best actress acting scenes I have ever seen ever. She was freaking phenomenal in this film. Now for all of them just mentioning it briefly but there is one sequence that had my mouth in ah and could not look away. A sequence that made me realize what an uplifting experience this entire film has been. Coming back to what I mentioned before this film will tear you to pieces with its editing, storytelling and subject matter. Also it's aspect of claustrophobia. And I will be fully understandable if this subject matter is something you or anyone else can't handle. I would never recommend watching this film ever if you feel that way about the subject matter. Trying not to be super dramatic but it's the truth. Darren Aronofsky understands the subject matter and throws his own unique spin on it giving it a very disturbing and very sad experience and is also a film and has also been deemed a film that no one should watch on a second viewing and it's the absolute truth. This is no blockbuster you can watch over and over again and be entertained by, this is a grounded dark tale that will already never leave your mind because of how it is. All in all if you can handle this subject matter I'd watch it for the experience and be done with it. Or if you're like me you might really like it but who knows. And another thing worth noting is this film is not trying to promote addiction. This is a film that a wanna be junkie will watch and probably will never want to do drugs ever. That's how terrifying this film is. Requiem for a Dream is one of the best and one if not the most disturbing and upsetting film I have ever seen in my life and I gonna give it a 10/10. Thank you so much for reading look forward to more reviews very soon.",SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,

Even though the characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, pathetically disgusting addictions, the cast performed well in getting through especially the young trio building up their stardom at the time. Only one communication found common sense through Leto's performance in one scene with words his character should have listened to and additionally become a hypocritical drug addict, which is a brutalized truth that people using drugs are arrogantly ignorant of the dangers posed against their well-beings – and that shows how Aronofsky should've gone further in communication rather than focusing on the depressing spiral. Fairly praiseworthy on the aesthetics through the cinematography and acceptable surrealism despite the discomfort, but how can it be rated into the like if it's not enjoyable? If you ever watch this film, whether nighttime or not, immediately follow it with a more positive film, doesn't matter if it's a good one or a bad one, just to get rid of what your eyes just tasted.

After bursting onto the scene with the bleak and unforgiving directorial debut that was ""Pi,"" Darren Aronofsky followed it up by tapping into the bibliography of author Hubert Selby Jr. and crafting this cinematic equivalent of one basically saying ""you ain't seen nothing yet."" As far as cinematic sack taps go, ""Requiem For A Dream"" isn't necessarily the most severe. But, dear God, is it going to be a massive buzzkill to whatever the hell you had going on in your life. As a visual experience, it is simply exhausting, but it's not all for naught. Many critics cite Aronofsky's provocative filmmaking style to be a bit excessive, if not obvious or lacking in finesse. And though I might find this critique to be true in some cases (i.e. ""mother!""), I think ""Requiem For A Dream"" might be that rare case where I couldn't see any other approach doing the story justice. This is a movie that hits that ""best of both worlds"" zone of provocateur filmmaking, where the product ultimately ends up being unnerving and difficult, yes, but also thought-provoking and called for.

Thanks to Aronofsky's direction that harmonized surreal visuals and sounds with the characters' feelings and experiences, I found myself experiencing and feeling what the characters experience and feel while watching the movie. Due to that, this is without a doubt one of the most disturbing and intoxicating movies I've ever watched. The problem is that the dramatic aspect in the movie actually harmed the movie; the dramatic scenes at the end of the first act slowed the pace of the movie down. It's not the only or the major issue I've with this movie. The real issue is that the creative direction that elevated the stereotypical arc of Sara Goldfarb, wasn't enough to do this with the stereotypical arc of Harry and Marion. Also, the oscar-worthy performance by Ellen Burstyn (I really wanna know how she didn't win an oscar) and a few complications in her character, Sara Goldfarb's part was way better and more compelling than Harry and Marion's. I really didn't found myself relate to the characters of Harry and Marion so much, despite the great performances that Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly gave. The perfect example that can affirm that the dramatic aspect wasn't the most powerful thing in the movie is the character of Tyrone; it's a very bland character and it was very hard for me to relate to its subplot, Marlon Wayans was very good though. I love Requiem for a Dream. It's a movie to experience not to watch. It really proves that Darren Aronofsky is a real talent that with his artistic direction can easily mess with your mind.

At times hard to watch, but even harder to forget, the film's pitch-perfect performances and spellbinding visual storytelling make it Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece.",,,
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/BQ8FKGIeahgehr6h98fAoI1NTV9,,,"Sep 3, 2017","Requiem for a Dream (2000), directed by Darren Aronofsky, kind of makes you wonder about the filmmaker's past, and just what spurred him to make a movie as dark and depressing as this. It practically screams ""Don't do drugs, kids!"" but it does so in the artsy kind of way that keeps you enthralled and never even approaches the area of preachy. In fact, it just makes you downright scared of addiction. Ranging from three of the seasons, summer to fall to ultimately winter, the film represents how the characters' lives get darker and colder with each season that progresses. Obviously, summer being the brightest and warmest, and winter being the darkest and coldest. Addiction is a real thing, and throughout the film, you'll see through Aronofsky's eyes the kind of effects it can (will) have on you. Throw in a beautiful, melancholy score, and you get a touching motion picture that you'll never forget. I can actually hear the Lux Aeterna melody as I write this, but that's probably because I'm listening to it right now. Requiem for a Dream hosts four main characters, Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, a more serious than normal Marlon Wayans as Tyrone, Jennifer Connelly as Marion, and Jared Leto as Harry Goldfarb, who has ties with each of the other three characters (mother, friend, girlfriend). Each of them is or will become addicted. And each of them meets different, yet terrible, fates in the end. Ellen Burstyn brings the character of Sara Goldfarb to life so well that it makes me never want to grow old. Starting out as a sweet, (if a little kooky) lonely old woman, her quest to become beautiful again for her game show appearance that she can't wait for causes her to become addicted to diet pills, and everything in her life spirals out of control from there. This film is not for everyone. If you'd rather watch a feel-good movie where the protagonist(s) prevail and everybody is happy in the end, you should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. Everyone else - come into this movie with an open mind and just enjoy the ride (if that's the correct phrase) that Aronofsky is about to take you through.",SHOW MORE,,

Requiem for a Dream is an exercise in how miserable can you make your audience without making them want to walk out, and it does that, fairly flawlessly. This Darren Aronofsky tragedy succeeds through strong writing, directing and powerful performances from an ensemble cast. Requiem For A Dream follows four Manhattan Beach characters; the son played by Jared Leto, (Dallas Buyers Club), his grandmother played by Ellen Burstyn, (The Exorcist, Interstellar), his girlfriend played by Jennifer Connely, (A Beautiful Mind, Blood Diamond), and his best friend played by Marlon Wayans, (White Chicks, Scary Movie). It follows them as they each build up their hopes and dreams, only to have it torn back down again by their own personal addictions. It's like Of Mice and Men on speed, literally, and good. I pitch this film to everyone as a must see, it's a film you should definitely see once, and then never again! It's based on a book by Hubert Selby Jr. who co-wrote the screenplay with Aronofsky, (Black Swan, The Wrestler), a writer famed for his understanding of that sort of low life New York culture and his skill in portraying it, and that really comes through in the film which is scuzzy beyond belief. The dialogue and syntax and slang of the characters really sell them as being in this world, an the grungy lighting, and subtly but meticulously crafted frames help. Subtle beauty, maybe Ang Lee can learn a thing or two. The reason Requiem For A Dream works so well is that before it tears them down, it builds up your relationship with the characters, gets you to empathise with them and feel for them and like them, it builds up their hopes and makes their dreams seem wonderfully possible before their falls. In fact that's literally the structure of the film, which is simple but genius, the three acts are denoted by the seasons; summer, fall, and winter. Our associations with each word complimenting the acts. This character involvement would't work if it wasn't for a collection of quite outstanding performances. Leto's accent is a bit ropey but you get used to it and he does everything else really well. There's one scene with a phone call that I nearly cried watching. I wanted to. Wayans gives an uncharacteristically serious performance and he does it really well. When people were wondering why on earth the man behind all these shit parody movies was being invited to join the American Academy I remembered Requiem For A Dream in which he is charismatic and empathetic. The real stand out though, is Elen Burstyn, who was actually Oscar nominated for this movie and boy does she deserve it. By far the most complex character she gives a powerhouse performance in which she is believable but just extraordinarily brittle. Again, there's a scene where Leto comes to visit that's by far the most memorable scene in the film and again I nearly welled up. In the end it's moments like those that are the key to understanding the hypnotic, mesmeric, enigmatic attraction of Requiem For A Dream, it has a lot of bleak imagery, and montages that will leave you traumatised but it's interspersed with moments of pathos and emotional sadness that are much more subtle and give the more traumatic sequences weight that without it would just seem gratuitous, and worse, slightly immature, using these images without any understanding of the weight they carry. However, luckily, Aronofsky and Selby Jr. know exactly what they're doing and they do it well. It's carried off with a style, professionalism and maturity that belies that this is only Aronofksy's second film, and first bigger budget one. Also, I have to mention Clint Mansell's beautiful, melancholy but perversely techno-influenced score, it's truly amazing.",SHOW MORE,,

The movie is divided in three parts: -SUMMER, where the characters are introduced, and where Aronofsky gives the audience hope about the future of them. The love between Harry and Marion is particularly exalted, like Sara's typical widow's way to live. All the main characters underestimate their addiction to drugs as they reach their top. -FALL, where everything start crumbling. Drugs take control over everyone's life. -WINTER, aka the saddest part of the movie. Not crying is a challenge at this point, as Arronofsky great technique to create a link to all the characters makes you feel like you are part of their lives.

During the Summer chapter of the movie, we truly believe that the characters may have a future, but come Winter, all hope is lost in one of the most effectively depressing and sobering scenes in all of cinema. Requiem, while not the most adult movie I've seen, is certainly inappropriate for younger audiences--yet, that is not the reason I might hesitate to recommend it. The ending is truly unsettling and saddening, and left me in a state of introspection and loneliness.",SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,

Amphetamines, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine & Opiates; this mix may not kill you but it's certainly going to try. The drama here revolves around the relationships of these friends and family. Altogether another fantastic film but yet again not journey for the weak at heart. This one will leave the boldest of the bunch; pale in the face. It's a visual spectacle as well; for Aronofsky to try such rapid edit techniques and experimental camera work at the time (2002) was truly avant guard. His next visual leap can be witnessed in 2006's The Fountain. Yet another of his signature films, intense and graphic. The performances here though are ahead of their time and the initial NC-17 rating will keep many from viewing.",SHOW MORE,,

The performances are strong, though no one really stood out- likely because of the majority of the film's subdued nature. However, when it does build up Burstyn delivers something memorable and fascinating. Really, it was Sara Goldfarb's story that kept me engaged and interested here and I think it easily made up for some of the film's weaker points. It would be very easy for a film taking itself this seriously to be nothing but a complete joke and whilst, this possibly comes somewhat close at times, it never actually ends up there and I think that's a credit to Aronofsky's direction- this isn't a film trying to be cool, it's just legitimately cool at times. The way he captures frantic addictive tendencies is a real technical achievement and it makes up for some of the script's, quite generic, interpretations of these same concepts. Deserving of its cult status but still just a little too nineties if we're being honest (though I believe it's technically a film of the noughties but, facts are irrelevant).",SHOW MORE,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/yrXFY9IjgfKzFzBHP9TqgIAXIjg,,,"Mar 27, 2016","Watching Requiem For a Dream was an experience with lasting effects. It's the most hopeless film I've seen to date with a completely ruthless portrayal of drug addiction and the horrors associated. This is not as much due to the subject matter, but more so to how the characters' struggles are so sympathetic, and these struggles being presented with such scrutiny by Darren Aronofsky and the cast that is devastatingly painful to watch. There is an unwavering sense of disgust from the opening scene, and it never lets up from there, making it the only film that I can confidently say I wanted to squirm in my seat while watching. It is an upsetting film in every sense of the word, made apparent by the emotional performances, the characters' goals in life slowly slipping through their fingers (hence the title) due to their use of drugs, and the uncomfortably close camera angles that give the viewer a cringe-inducing sense of entrapment. It's easy to think of this film before seeing it and assume it is purely dependent on the significance of the subject matter with no substance from a filmmaking standpoint. However, if the film lacked in filmmaking, it would not be nearly as upsetting. Darren Aronofsky knows how to trap the viewers into the horrible events with a stellar cast, Clint Mansell's haunting score, and an unwavering sense of dread. This dread is made possible by how the characters are crafted. Watching them abandon dignity, hold onto false hope, and stomach such disturbing situations made me almost struggle to stay seated, a feat no other film has accomplished. One cannot talk about this film without mentioning Ellen Burstyn's performance. She is tied with Essie Davis in The Babadook for my favorite performance by an actress. What they do so well is make the viewers feel such pity for their miserable lives with performances so convincing that it's easy to forget that they are actors. Although Burstyn outshines everyone else, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly are fantastic in their roles, doing what Aronofsky most definitely expected them to do: Make the audience feel their characters' pain. As well as the performances, what Aronofsky does technically is equally astounding. Whether a director can add more layers to the story than what is on paper is what separates a mediocre director from a great one, and Aronofsky proves himself to be the latter. Aronofsky uses the same editing technique each time a specific character takes a specific drug, for instance. As the viewer counts the times the technique is used, they feel more and more despair as the characters addictions become gradually stronger. *****SPOILERS FOLLOW***** Where his technical skills really shined for me was the final scene where he wraps up the film perfectly. He shows a montage of our characters laying down, and provides so much with this one directorial choice. All characters except that of Jared Leto assume the fetal position. My interpretation of this is that it's a gesture of despair, conveying a similarity between them. The position also indicates that they are clutching the one thing that helps them take their mind off their new unbearable lives. The reason Harry (Jared Leto) does not assume the position is that he has nothing to hold on to. Every other character does, but the thing that gives them hope is what makes each character arc distinct from the others. Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) clutches the thought of his mother, making him the most hopeful character since he is being forcefully held from his drugs and still has thoughts of a peaceful life. Although the movie shared a theme with Trainspotting in conveying the frightful easiness of slipping into addiction with the story of Sara (Ellen Burstyn), Darren Aronofsky himself said that Tyrone is the only character with hope of escape. Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is similar in that she has something that gives her hope, but different in that she has completely abandoned her life. She curls herself around the heroin she went to such desperate measures to get her hands on, showing how drugs are her salvation from her new life even though they are the cause. The film concludes with perhaps the most depressing character arc in the movie, which is that of Sara Goldfarb. Solidifying the heart-breaking monologue she gives earlier, the thing she holds on to is the fantasy of appearing on television. She knows this will never happen, but the thought of it comforts her. Within this fantasy, her son Harry is implied to have married his girlfriend Marion and appears well-dressed and happy. Him and his mother tell each other they love each other, and the film fades to its end credits. What makes this character arc the most depressing out of all of the others is that her son's life and their relationship being healthy is within the fantasy of her appearing on television. This suggests that her son loving her and vice versa is just as outlandish as her television fantasy. That notion is emphasized further by Sara smiling, but tears running down her eyes can be seen. The way Aronofsky presented the film's wrap-up is the major highlight of his directorial talents within this movie. He knew to convey more ideas visually than what is shown through dialogue and the actors' performances, making this movie's presentation of the subject matter all the more complex. Although it is a film that had me emotionally drained long after seeing it, I cannot deny that it is excellently crafted.",SHOW MORE,,

It's a mistake to have nominally updated the story's setting to the present day since several aspects of the plot only really make sense in the context of the book's early 70's time frame. While the film is stylish, it's also generally realistic and believable in tone, which makes the excessiveness of the Ellen Burstyn's hallucinations in one key scene stand out as too much.

When talking amongst other addicts about movies on this subject, usually Requiem for a Dream is everyone's favorite, for being so realistic and in your face. But just cause something is realistic does not mean it is automatically going to make a great feature length film. Jared Leto is really good in this movie portraying the role of the drug addict very authentically. Just his physical look alone. The soundtrack is downright disturbing and matches the subject matter perfectly. It is funny though, most people will say the standout performance in Requiem is from Ellen Burstyn, I disagree, I think Leto takes the cake for this movie. The mother's descent into addiction due to a fascination that she is going to be on a television show and must lose weight becomes really disturbing and almost annoying by the end of the movie. This is a movie that you feel like you need to take a shower after you watch it, because you feel so dirty. Yes it is a very authentic movie when it comes to addiction, but a tad over the top if you ask me, if they cut out some of the more disturbing things, I think this movie really would have been better, but that's just me.

Requiem is the chilling tale that surrounds 4, drug addicted human beings, who are all connected. It documents the progression of the rise and fall of drug addiction, showing the glamorous highs and the frightening lows, highlighting the extremes people will go to, in order to get their next fix. In Aronofsky's second outing, he manages to craft a film so unique and arresting, its almost impossible to look away, despite the horror unfolding on screen. Led by an all star cast, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waynes, Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, Aronofsky lobs his characters into the depths of hell and then for good measure throws us, the audience, in after them. Shot in a stylish but very rough looking demeanor, Requiem may fool you into thinking your about to witness the same old drug related tale, however the script soon pole vaults into another world, full of dreams and aspirations, demands and exceptions, Aronofsky isnt afraid to tackle some difficult subject matter here, really getting into the meat off all 4 characters downfalls and its harrowing to watch. His quick cut and ominous style becomes a staple of normality straight off the bat and paces the film wonderfully. Requiem doesnt feel bloated, nor does it ever grind to a halt, its constantly on the move, utilizing sound and a blistering soundtrack from Clint Mansell and The Kronos Quartet, to its full advantage. The film weaves in and out of normality, using a wide array of visual techniques, in order to disorientate the audience, which by the finale will have you feeling like you, yourself are coming off a year long drug binge. It's horrible and gritty, intense and creative, stylish and violent to such an extent, Requiem should come with a viewer discretion advised sticker.

I am serious though...I don't think I can watch this film again. The last 15 minutes literally gave me a nervous breakdown. I mean, it was heavy, Doc!

Surrounded by many movies like it such as Trainspotting and The Basketball Diaries, this is the only one that genuinely both moved and disturbed me. It is a tough watch but definitely a movie that all people (with strong stomachs) should check out. This movie shows drug addiction through stories about a widowed woman, played to perfection by Ellen Burstyn, her son Harry, a great Jared Leto, his girlfriend Marion, a good Jennifer Connelly, and his best friend Tyrone, a spectacular Marlon Wayans at his best. All of these characters have a view of happiness that they are all trying to reach but addiction is getting in the way of them reaching it. All of the performances are off the charts. Every one in this movie gives it their all and it shows. The writing is great the dialogue is spot on. The direction is perfect from Darren Aronofsky, he really know how to make the audience feel like they are on drugs, and the cinematography is chilling, bleak, and perfect. And the score, oh my god the score, is so perfect and disturbing and fitting for this film. The sound track alone will give you chills. It really is one if the best soundtracks of all time in my opinion. Requiem for a Dream is a dark disturbing tale that is not for people who are bothered by strong depictions of addiction. It makes drugs not look fun for a change. It makes you not want to do them, which it was meant to do. This movie is great, and I have no flaws with it.",SHOW MORE,,

It reminds me of Fear And Loathing without the humor, without the likable characters, and the movie doesn't mean anything. It's the cinematic equivalent of an anti-drug PSA and has all the subtlety of Reefer Madness. But as someone who appreciates the art of downer cinema I give the movie credit for having some of the most distressing scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It didn't effect me emotionally because I just didn't care about the characters. It tries to pull a Martin Scorsese by showing us bad people who get it in the end, but Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are no Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. This might sound cruel, but the film kind of reminds me of an Itchy And Scratchy cartoon. Like I said, the exception are a few very pitiful scenes, but if you saw a real mouse chop up a real cat with a chainsaw you might find that a little more shocking. I think Aronofsky is overrated, but he's definitely a visionary.

It is easily one of the most detailed looks into how drug abuse can destroy your life. Aronofsky uses every trick in the director's playbook to give the audience the sensation of being affected by the addictions of the main characters. There is shaky camera work, there are dramatic focus shifts. Even the music is used to create an unsettling atmosphere. It puts you on edge as a viewer, and makes it utterly impossible to relax while watching the movie. Perhaps the most amazing thing to me was that the actors actually managed to make their characters sympathetic to me. There were moments where I actually wanted them to have a successful sale in order to dig themselves out of the pit they had fallen into. Typically it's hard for me to identify with a movie character who continues to make the wrong decisions, but some magical combination of the script and the acting had me rooting for these people. One of the most effective techniques that Aronofsky used in this film are the repetitive smash-cut montages of each step that goes into taking drugs. It made for a really artistic way of showing how the drug abuse had become routine to the characters, and it also offered a great contrast when later Ellen Burstyn's character became addicted to her own drug of choice. I also enjoyed what this film had to say about people who struggle with a less toxic, but perhaps just as damaging, addiction like television. It makes you question your own life and look to see what you have grown overly attached to that might be getting in the way of more important things. The one thing about Requiem for a Dream that kind of holds me back from absolutely falling in love with it is that this film is exceedingly hard to watch. In fact I can't picture subjecting myself to it again, at least not for a really long time. While I do think it is amazingly well-constructed, and startlingly realistic, there's nothing that would prompt me to want to go through that again.",SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,

However, few movies have been able to capture what drug addiction does to our bodies, to our minds, and to our lifestyle so well. If you want someone close to you to stop drug addiction, make them watch this movie; it's *that* shocking.",SHOW MORE,,
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/qA0FO9hpwTlASRauzxS9xskmSzw,,,"Jul 1, 2014","While most people see movies solely for entertainment value, several of us actually welcome a challenge. Requiem for a Dream is a graphic and often unpleasant movie, but it's evident that was the intention. Disney cartoons and comic-book blockbusters are all fine and good, but movies like this are the reason I'm a movie addict. Movies about young, strung-out junkies are not new. Movies like Another Day in Paradise, Rush, and Kids all addressed similar issues, to varying degrees of success. The tough part is not showing the ugliness of heroin addiction. Just watch someone shooting up and you're seeing a tragedy. What's difficult is presenting honest characters, and not apologizing for their actions. They're not heroes or villains in Aronofsky's hands, and how you feel about these characters lies with you. The screenplay doesn't guide you, and any movie that forces you to decide things for yourself is always a welcome change. Everyone has their addictions, right? For some, it's crack cocaine. Others can't function without their morning cup of coffee. Love, contentment, approval, happiness; Wish for any of them too hard, and you find yourself an addict. Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream displays how rampant addiction affects the lives of four interlocked characters, and it's not a pretty picture. But that's exactly why this is an excellent movie. While several scenes are of unnerving discomfort, the intention is never simply to shock. A filmmaker can ""stun"" an audience whenever he wants to; it's his party. The tough part is to tell a story and prove thematic points by using the shock value responsibly. Harry (Jared Leto) is a heroin addict. When we first meet him, he is appropriating his mother's television set to hock for his next ""fix"". Long-suffering mother Sarah (Ellen Burstyn) screams with her son, but never really gets angry with him. Five minutes later, she's simply buying the TV back. Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) also participate in Harry's hypodermic activities, and the three eventually hatch a plan: To become dealers on their own and make thousands of bucks! Meanwhile, Sarah has received a strange phone call, promising her a spot as a TV contestant. Alone in her home, she quickly begins preparing for her night on TV by popping diet pills. This is a movie of several excellent components, most notably a handful of excellent performances, a restrained yet visually stunning directorial style, and a hypnotic musical score. While a handful of scenes linger a bit too long, that's a nearly pointless complaint in a movie so strong on nearly every other level. Requiem for a Dream is not a ""fun"" movie, nor is it merely a drug-related melodrama. This is a smart movie about how addiction shackles people, for movie fans who can handle the heavy stuff. Ellen Burstyn is remarkable in this movie. While she hasn't been seen in films too often lately, her performance simply should place her back in this should have placed her in the public eye. As a woman who becomes increasingly more unable to deal with reality, she is heart-breakingly believable, and the result is one of the best acting performances I have seen. Also quite surprising is the work of Jennifer Connelly, in a nearly impossible role. Her stunning beauty has somehow mislabeled her as a ""pin-up"" actress, as she's nearly always excellent, regardless of how small the role. She'll get a lot of attention for her courageous performance. Jared Leto is serviceable as the anti-hero Harry. Although it's easy to buy him as a junkie, he simply plays his role too clean-cut most of the time. Leto is tough to buy him as a sleazy addict when he looks like the cover of a Teen magazine. Director Aronofsky presents several unique sequences, and he offers several harsh and resonant montage sequences, some truly shocking visual sequences, and a wonderfully effective usage of sound effects. (Each moment of addiction satisfaction is presented in a rapid-fire display of color, light and sound.) Especially memorable is the use of the infectious score by Clint Mansell, which gives the movie a dark, desperate heartbeat. Much has currently been made of the MPAA's decision to threaten this movie an NC-17 rating, thanks to a sequence near the end, which depicts some particularly unsavory acts. Apparently, The MPAA missed the point of this movie entirely. By deleting (or even editing) the scene in question would negate the entire point of the movie: That true addiction leads to true degradation. I was glad he didn't compromise. I can't promise that you'll love this movie, but you'll be able to see how censoring a movie can sometimes disembowel it. Requiem for a Dream is a tough movie to watch, but the film offers a lot to enjoy. Darren Aronofsky deftly avoids many of the ""drug-movie"" cliches so evident in other films of this style, and his film is a sobering and fascinating piece of work. While this movie is NOT for all tastes, I can recommend it as one of the best and bravest drug-movies ever made . Requiem for a Dream is a film that will stay with you long after you leave the theater, and it's a rare film that can do that.",SHOW MORE,,

This movie gives us a very realistic portrayal of drugs and the dark corners of humans and how far they can go for it. This movie honestly scares with its realism. The performances are Top-Notch! And why didn't the theme song ""Requiem for a Tower"" win/get nominated for any Oscars? It is awesome and just like the movie, Bone chilling. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen...but I never want to see it again. Understand my logic?",SHOW MORE,,

Requiem for a Dream plays out in a way that can only have been drawn from someone's deepest psychological terrors that come out to play in the time of twilight, in which the definite barrier between reality and hallucination is commonly deteriorated. This is probably one of Mr Mackey's favourite movies.",SHOW MORE,,
