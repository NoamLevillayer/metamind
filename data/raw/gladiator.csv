Ridley Scott delivers a sweeping vision of ancient Rome, crafting battles that are both massive in scale and deeply personal. Russell Crowe gives one of his most iconic performances as Maximus, a tragic hero whose journey of vengeance and honor resonates just as powerfully today. Joaquin Phoenix’s Commodus is equally unforgettable, bringing menace and fragility to the role of a desperate emperor. Hans Zimmer’s haunting score lingers long after the credits, amplifying both the spectacle and the sorrow. While the pacing occasionally slows, the film’s emotional weight and visual mastery more than make up for it. For some, it’s a near-perfect film, for others, an untouchable masterpiece. Either way, Gladiator stands as one of cinema’s greatest achievements a film that redefined the modern epic and continues to captivate audiences decades later.",SHOW MORE,

I finally understood the critical and commercial acclaim the film garnered, in addition to, of course, its Oscar wins. The film's script is extremely well-constructed and makes us care about all the characters, especially the protagonist, whose development is one of the best I've ever seen. Ridley's direction is inspired, with memorable scenes in the Roman Colosseum. The cinematography is also a highlight, with scenes that resemble a painting, especially those highlighting the green fields, the mountainous landscape, and the blue sky. The soundtrack is memorable, and through it, we can sense the grandeur of the action and battles throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a dangerous and multifaceted villain, who murdered his own father to declare himself Emperor of Rome and who courts his own sister in his desperate search for attention and devotion. I regret it took me so long to see this film, but no more so than not seeing it in theaters. In 2000, I was just a kid, and my film tastes were limited to Disney, Jurassic Park, and superhero movies. Those who were lucky enough, however, must have had an epic cinematic experience, which is what this film provides.",SHOW MORE,

Ridley Scott’s direction is grand yet intimate, balancing sweeping battle sequences with quieter, emotional moments that give the film its soul. Russell Crowe delivers a commanding and heartfelt performance as Maximus, portraying a character driven by pain, principle, and purpose. Joaquin Phoenix, equally compelling, gives a chilling portrayal of corruption and weakness beneath power. The cinematography is gorgeous, the score by Hans Zimmer is iconic, and the storytelling is tight, immersive, and emotionally resonant.

You can't help but feel inspired seeing a man (Maximus) of sheer will and determination overcome adversity to do what he needed to do. The fight scenes are life or death and you'll constantly be on edge hoping that our hero won't get slashed or stabbed by all the swords and spears swinging around. Russell Crowe did a phenomenal job conveying the heartbreak, anger, and courage of Maximus as it's impossible to not cheer for the guy after all that he went through. Joaquin Phoenix also did an amazing job with Commodus. I've never had seen a villain that boiled my blood so much and I was so happy when fell. The ending is bittersweet and a perfect ending to a movie. At the end of the day, it's not about whether we come out alive or not but if we find our peace at the end knowing that we did everything that we could to do. Because when death smiles at us all, all a man can do is smile back. ∞🤞",SHOW MORE,

EPIC - GRITTY - INSPIRING - MAGNIFICENT Gladiator is every man's appropriate response to such loss. I'd wake up a gladiator too if I were Maximus. The sheer scale of this film has me in awe. For 2000? Oh yeah. Production design is on another level... can we please make movies like this again??? The visual effects aren't my favorite though. The color grading for the afterlife sequences is too dull, and between the floating heads and the glitchy slow-motion shots feel cheesy, but it's not enough to derail the film. Apparently the Academy loved it though... None of that pulls from the magnificent performances of the cast, notably Crowe. Just... wow. Seeing this, I understand where he pulls that stoic energy from for some of his other roles (Robin Hood, The Water Diviner, Man of Steel, Master and Commander). It's the story and script that are the muscle of this film (though it seems the Academy disagrees on this point as well...). A man... who has lost everything... wife, son, honor, status... and all so horrifically... tossed to the gladiators of Rome to be slaughtered for sport... and we are on the very EDGE of our seats to see... what does he do next? Will he give up? Will he give in to the overwhelming grief that even we can seem to taste... or will he rise up, in the face of every adversity... and fight the very emperor himself to regain his lost honor and restore justice to a corrupt nation? That is the story in every man, even at the simplest level. There is nothing more inspiring than that. The script sets up everything so well to come crashing down, slowly builds up again, sparks hope, then all is lost... creating the perfect conditions to forge a hero. Trust me. You'll understand when you see it. While being heavily masculine, it doesn't lose a single drop of emotion. It's a rollercoaster. Great lines bring some enthusiastic ""oh yeah!!!""-moments, while Maximus' loss stabs your heart strings, and victories throughout leave you cheering. Just for laughs...... I saw many other films before seeing Gladiator... so my initial reaction is through this lens: Dumbledore and Robin Hood try to overthrow the Joker as emperor of the Roman Empire.",SHOW MORE,

I was ten when this came out and could never see this due to being raised differently. But seeing this for the first time, I do see why folks consider this a masterpiece. However, this isn't as much of a masterpiece to me. I was entertained, though. So the story is a bit simple from a revenge story to overthrowing a usurper who murdered his own father. I do get behind with it as it was built okay. Just wish the beginning needed a little more time to develop. Though it would make the movie a little longer, but that might be me. In the second and last third is where it gets better between the interactions with the characters, the action in the colosseum and the ending, which I will keep that a secret. The best that I could give out of this are the music score with both Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, the setting of the movie along with their costumes and the action like I'm watching an actual gladiator fight. Sure, I will admit, this is like a dad film, but still worth it to see the actors play it out. In my personal opinion, I didn't think too much of the Commodus, played by Joaquin Pheonix, being that much of a threat until the third act when he gets better until he gets his just desserts at the end. Granted, he is played as a corrupted politician, yet I can believe him being similar to the usual ""big, bad, businessman"" troupe that I was never too fond of in movies. Fortunately, he does get better by the third act of the film. Everyone else does great from Russel Crowe as the main lead to work his way back up to the ranks to entertain the crowd along with his interactions through his life as a slave to gladiator. Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed and Djimon Hounsou were also great in their roles when interacting with Maximus as the story goes. The other characters did well in their given roles, too. Simple, yes, but was still entertained as a whole when seeing this film for the first time. Even to see Ridley Scott's work in his prime. For this, I give this eight Russel Crowe yelling to the crowd, ""Are you not entertained,"" out of ten. 8/10.",SHOW MORE,

Now, as an adult, watching this sequel, it’s incredible to see the evolution of the story, the characters, and the production values. The storyline effectively blends historical elements with modern sensibilities, and as someone with a strong appreciation for history, I found it particularly engaging. It’s a stark reminder of how much the world and our technology have evolved. While the original film, released in 2000, still holds up visually, this latest installment takes things to another level in terms of beauty and innovation. It’s truly remarkable to witness. The performances across the board were outstanding. From Denzel Washington to Pedro Pascal, each actor fully embraced their role, creating a sense of authenticity and depth. However, Paul Mescal deserves special recognition. His performance was exceptional, demonstrating impressive range and emotional depth that significantly elevated the film. Every actor brought something unique to their role, contributing to a compelling and immersive experience. The cinematography was also a standout. The shots, camera angles, and color gradients were all meticulously crafted to enhance the story visually. The director clearly had a strong vision for the film, and it was executed brilliantly. As someone with a background in film studies, I greatly appreciated the attention to detail in every frame. What I particularly appreciated about this sequel is how it provided closure for fans of the original film. In an era where many sequels feel like cash grabs, this one felt like a true continuation of the story, with genuine care and respect for the source material. It was a refreshing change, and the filmmakers succeeded in preserving what made the first film special while expanding the narrative in a satisfying way. The pacing was another strength. At no point did I find myself disengaged or bored; the film maintained a steady rhythm that kept me invested from beginning to end. Overall, I would rate this film a solid 10/10. I have no complaints and am extremely satisfied with the final product. It’s a rare sequel that truly honors its predecessor while delivering something new and exciting.",SHOW MORE,

It immerses viewers in a journey reminiscent of Greek mythology, where fierce battles unfold in the grand arena. The film begins in a chaotic war setting, leaving audiences disoriented as they try to grasp the direction of the story. However, it soon settles into a gripping tale of conflict, chaos, and combat. The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, showcasing exceptional craftsmanship throughout the film. The character development is compelling, allowing viewers to connect with the protagonists and understand their motivations and the path they are on. The overall experience is remarkable, and I strongly recommend watching this film before diving into its sequel. While I generally don't gravitate towards this genre, I found ""Gladiator"" to be a worthwhile one-time experience. Its length is a bit daunting for me to consider a repeat viewing, but the storytelling and concept are commendable. One aspect that strikes me as peculiar is seeing Russell Crowe as the leading character in ""Gladiator,"" especially when he portrays Zeus in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His physique seems mismatched for the role of a god in that universe. It's not about body shaming; it's simply that casting choices should align with character expectations. It’s puzzling to witness Crowe, who fits the mold of a divine figure in ""Gladiator,"" not meet the same standards in the MCU. Age shouldn't be an excuse in Hollywood, where the industry often overlooks it.",SHOW MORE,

At the beginning of the film, the magnificence of the Roman Empire stands in sharp contrast to the cruelty of the gladiatorial arena. Maximus, originally a renowned general with numerous military exploits, was reduced to a gladiator due to a court conspiracy. In the gladiatorial arena, he demonstrated unparalleled courage and combat wisdom, and each battle was thrilling. The scenes of the yellow sand filling the air and the earth-shattering shouts made the audience feel as if they were right there. Russell Crowe vividly portrayed Maximus' firmness, pain, and longing for his family. In the face of hardships, he remained unyielding, and his determined eyes conveyed his persistent pursuit of justice and freedom. Meanwhile, the madness and cruelty of the villain Commodus were also depicted incisively and vividly, forming a sharp contrast with Maximus. The theme of the film is profound. It not only sings the praises of heroism but also reflects on power, desire, and human nature. The gladiatorial arena is a stage of life and death as well as a place where human nature is laid bare. Maximus finally won glory in the gladiatorial arena and avenged his family. His legend has become a brilliant yet tragic chapter in the long history of Rome, leaving the audience immersed in that world full of passion and legend long after watching the film, feeling the glory and sorrow of the hero.

Commodus' jealousy, ambition, and madness make him a highly charismatic villain. He is eager to obtain his father's recognition, but due to his own character flaws, he has embarked on a path of no return. Meanwhile, Maximus' longing for his family and his obsession with revenge enable him to maintain a firm belief in difficult situations. The friendship he has established with other gladiators, such as the mutual admiration with Juba, also adds a touch of warmth to this bloody and violent movie. The incorporation of these emotional elements allows the audience to gain a deeper understanding of the inner worlds of the characters, thus generating a strong emotional resonance.

When it comes to storytelling, its originality was buried beneath the sands by its formulaic and bloated narrative and grim tone. However, the film is another example of utilizing its style, visual grandeur, and emotional core to elevate most of the narrative shortcomings. As mentioned earlier, Ridley Scott is seen as a visual storyteller attempting to balance the seemingly straightforward plots with the splendor of the cinematic scales, gloomy atmospheres, action set pieces, and character-driven drama. While most of his films aren’t as great as others, Scott has repeatedly proven that his presentation shines the most in balancing blockbuster aesthetics with an authentic and down-to-earth atmosphere, with “Gladiator” being one of those examples. With its stellar cast, compelling direction, suitable screenplay, and outstanding technical aspects, the movie has enough bloodshed and appeal to entertain plenty of fans of Scott’s works.",SHOW MORE,

Gladiator es una película épica del cine moderno que hasta a la altura de muchos clásicos del cine épico. Russell Crowe ofrece lo mejor de su carrera cinematográfica como Maximus en su búsqueda por vengar la muerte de su familia y la del honorable Marcus Aurelius tras ser traicionado por su propio hijo Commodus. Es una de esas historias donde el imperio romano tenía a un gobernador que consiguió poder por medio de la traición y la muerte de sus seres más confiables. Commodus ansiaba ser el nuevo Cesar después de que su padre falleciera y estaba dispuesto a conservar ese poder aun si debía eliminar a sus obstáculos. Maximus era la persona ideal para liderar roma, pero termino siendo traicionado por Commodus y eso desata todo el argumento de la película. Vemos como Maximus pasa de ser un esclavo a un admirable gladiador y así obtener la oportunidad de encontrarse nuevamente con Commodus y liberar a Roma de un emperador tirano. Es una historia que está muy bien relatada y la buena producción hace de esta película una agradable experiencia. Las escenas de combate, la banda sonora de Hans Zimmer y el vestuario son dignos de este tipo de películas. Ridley Scott logró hacer una película que le hace honor al cine épico y eso hace que Gladiator sea otra de las mejores películas que se hayan hecho. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10.",SHOW MORE,

Maximus is not the only protagonist, there is a rich pool of other protagonists, all visually undergoing a journey of character growth and forming deep emotional bonds on screen. He captures the heartbreak of Maximus losing everything he holds dear exquisitely, and the pace and nature of his rising from the ashes to greatness once again is equally exquisite. The dialogue is careful and articulated (not too word heavy) and the magic is in how the characters carry themselves in body language, deeds, and manner.

It is less of a revenge story, as some suggest, and is more of a graphic saga about why words like justice, strength, and honor ought to prevail over greed, envy, and corruption. From a technical standpoint, I don’t think there is a single poorly casted actor, stunt, costume, score piece, set, or scripting that falters throughout the film, with one of the most quotable lines in cinematic history, “Are you not entertained?!” If there are historical inaccuracies, so be it. Crowe’s performance is second to none portraying an honorable soldier and a humble, non-greedy husband who must overcome a coup attempt of murder on his life after he just won a last war for Rome, and then the incredibly tragic scene of betrayal towards his beloved family and home. Apart from Heath Ledger’s Joker performance and Gollum in the Lord of the Ring’s, I often put Phoenix’s portrayal of Commodus as the third best villain of all time in cinematic history, and have struggled to see him as anything else ever since his role in the movie. There are many parallels throughout the film that can be applied to modern life and politics making it a relevant film adding social commentary on current affairs.

Directed by Ridley Scott, this masterpiece takes viewers on a gripping journey through ancient Rome, weaving a tale of revenge, honor, and redemption that leaves an indelible mark on the heart and mind. Russell Crowe delivers a powerful performance as Maximus Decimus Meridius, a once-noble general turned slave who seeks vengeance against the corrupt emperor, Commodus, played brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe's portrayal is both fierce and vulnerable, capturing the essence of a man stripped of everything yet fueled by an unyielding desire for justice. The dynamic between Maximus and Commodus is electric, showcasing the stark contrast between integrity and moral decay. The cinematography is breathtaking, with sweeping landscapes and meticulously crafted battle scenes that immerse the audience in the grandeur of the Roman Empire. The film's visual richness is complemented by Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which elevates every moment, enhancing the emotional depth and intensity of the narrative. Scott’s direction is masterful, balancing epic scale with intimate character moments, making each victory and loss resonate deeply. The screenplay is tight and impactful, filled with memorable quotes and poignant themes that explore the complexities of power, loyalty, and the human spirit. ""Gladiator"" is more than just a historical epic; it’s a timeless tale that explores the struggles of the individual against tyranny and the quest for personal redemption. It’s a film that inspires and captivates, leaving viewers both exhilarated and reflective. In summary, ""Gladiator"" is a flawless blend of compelling storytelling, stellar performances, and breathtaking visuals. It is, without a doubt, a must-see cinematic experience that solidifies its place as one of the greatest films of all time.",SHOW MORE,

And how exactly does Maximus (injured) get from territory that is now Germany, across the Alps, across the Pyrenees, and deep into Iberia, before magically being found by the Moors? How does Commodus kill Richard Harris without Harris showing any struggle? The action slows down for self important reflective sounds and music. Including Celtic sounding pretentious theme music.

Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against the Germanic tribes. Emperor Marcus Aurelius played by Richard Harris, tells him that his brother, Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix, will not rule as emperor and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore the Roman Republic. Marcus informs Commodus of his decision; but in response, he murders his father. He proclaims himself as the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and is wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium, where he finds his wife and child crucified. Slavers find him and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo. Despite that this is similar to every Moses story, this movie is awesome in every way possible with it's fantastic fight sequences even when Maximus won his first match against other gladiators I said "" Ah ha ha ha! Are you not entertained?"" right before he said ""Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?"" Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both fantastic in this playing off against each other. There are plenty of epic movies I've seen during to this day, some of which are both go up to three hours and down to three hours in that category. Gladiator is a fantastic epic historical action drama that builds up for it's immense cinematography, fantastic acting, great directing and good music by Hans Zimmer. If there is one thing I'd like to mention while doing this review is that when you get to see Richard Harris again, you'll get to see him again as Professor Dumbledore in Harry Potter. Hahaha. Yeah. This movie is very good and is the one I will watch over and over every time I'm in the mood to be entertained.",SHOW MORE,

Gladiator is a phenomenal achievement in cinema. The execution is near-flawless, with excellent storytelling, directing, acting and everything in between. The first act is full of exposition, which can get tiresome. However, once you hit the 45 minute mark, it is full steam ahead. The story of redemption is incredibly captivating and leaves a mark. Maximus is a powerful character and his foil, Commodus, is despicable. To cap it all off, the finale of this film is one of the best in modern film history. I don't think of the Roman Empire often, but when I do, it is because of Gladiator. Best Character: Maximus Best Quote: ""My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius..."" Best Scene: Elysium Best Piece of Score: ""Now We Are Free"" Note: I love Hans Zimmer, but the Pirates of the Caribbean score is a little too close to this.",SHOW MORE,

All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent.

Jokes about the complete lack of historical accuracy aside, Gladiator has some strong points - Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) makes for a decent villain, the camerawork is strong, and the action, while occasionally spoiled by the dated slow-motion effects, is satisfying. Unfortunately, the screenplay is entirely unbefitting a Best Picture winner. It is full of pseudo-profundities and is unnecessarily depressing, fridging the main character's family almost immediately in the most horrific way possible. Worse, the awful events Maximus experiences provoke little character development beyond making him a bit bitter. He is not the only one with vague characterization: the screenplay provides little in the way of coherent character motivations for the actors (save perhaps Phoenix) to work with, and perhaps consequently, almost every line is delivered like a speech or soliloquy even when this is inappropriate for the context. Gladiator is an alright film if you want to turn your brain off and enjoy the sights, but critics often present the film as intellectually-engaging art, a modern Spartacus, which it most definitely is not.",SHOW MORE,

I hadn't seen Gladiator for seventeen years, and I've wondered for a long time whether I would hold it in the same high regard I did as a fourteen year old. Especially as the last Ridley Scott film I saw was another of his historical epics, the directors cut of Kingdom Of Heaven (2005), which was boring bordering on insulting. Orlando Bloom sank the film like one of the many boulders falling to the ground in the films' action sequences, which served as a far too infrequent alarm clock for me throughout its seeming three day run time. Gladiator, thankfully, is every bit as impressive the second time round. Ridley Scott has always been a fabulous world builder, (that includes Kingdom Of Heaven) and his vision of Rome is staggering. Russell Crowe can be a figure of ridicule at times, but is on mellowed, low key, Oscar winning form here, and he is terrific. It's not often that a film with so many action fight sequences can hold you on the edge of your seat for all of them, but Gladiator achieves this in spades, and is genuinely thrilling. Joaquin Phoenix is pitifully creepy and superbly effective as the villainous Commodus, and Connie Nielsen provides excellent support, alongside the late Richard Harris in a small role. Apart from perhaps The Martian (2015), it's a long time since Scott has been on top form, and Gladiator reminds you of how good he can be.",SHOW MORE,

This was Ridley Scott at the start of the digital age and his first colossal success since Thelma and Louise. Even then it managed to top that. It carried expectations with its overall marketing, starring one of the biggest stars in the world at that point Russell Crowe and would be the first of a handful of collaborations between Crowe and Scott. Pretty much putting Scott back on form after several financial misfires. At the height of the Roman Empire under the rule of Marcus Aurelius, his general Maximus, played by Crowe, leads his army to conquer and secure the nation of Germania with great success. Emperor Aurelius, nearing the end of his life, believes the political state of Rome has been corrupted. Primarily by morally backwards senators and his own son and heir to be, Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix. Aurelius entrusts Maximus with leading the city of Rome because of his loyalty, but Maximus instead seeks to return to his family after time in battle. Commodus gets wind of this and in his madness becomes upset and kills Aurelius in an embrace and frames Maximus for the crime – sentencing him to be executed. Maximus escapes with his life and rides to find his family brutally murdered by Commodus's men. Left bereft, his wounded self is captured by slave traders. Who sell him to a head gladiator trainer, Proximus played by Oliver Reed who reluctantly trains him to survive in the Gladiator Arena. Proving himself popular with the crowd, they move to the colosseum in Rome where the now Commodus reins emperor to little appeal amongst the senators. Maximus confronts Commodus in the arena and declares he will use what he can to avenge his family, no matter what. Even with the first scene of the battle to conquer Germania, you can get a real feeling of what you're in for. The sequence alone has plenty of sword cleaving, heads rolling, plenty of Braveheart-esque action that it's hard to look away. All the battle sequences - whether here or in the arena are particularly brutal. Choreographed in a way that genuinely makes them authentic and genuine of the period. Backed by the spectacle on-screen is a barnstorming central performance from Russell Crowe. Who really made his name across the world with this film and clearly seeks to take centre stage amongst the rest of the cast and the drama unfolding. With Joaquin Phoenix playing the central antagonist as effectively foolhardy. He plays him as the most exceptional combination of mad and pathetic that I ever have seen and for that, it's entertaining. The film went through several re-writes and production problems, and because of that, the film is far from perfect. There is the dialogue in this film such as the trailer line from earlier like, ""Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my revenge, in this life or the next"" or ""There was a dream that was Rome. It shall be released"" that I can't tell if they're genius or plain silly – so I'm settling for both. There are notably CGI inputs within the film. Clearly, are added due to time or unfortunate circumstances that occurred during the production such as Oliver Reed's untimely death halfway through shooting or the remodelling of the Coliseum. With that and Reed's computer-generated death scene, it stands out as jarring. There is a lot of Roman political discussions behind the scenes and does get bogged down with the major plot with Maximus and his revenge. There is a subplot involving Derek Jacobi's senator Gracchus who wants to overthrow Commodus to restore order. However, it primarily takes a step back and is used to move the plot forward through its three hour running time. While there are noticeable flaws that do question its best picture win at the Oscars. Gladiator has enough spectacle, breathtaking scenes of brutal pathos, battle choreography and style that recalls the most influential films of the classic Sword & Sandal genre. It has performers that either act to the point of the camp and those that give the film a really epic and dramatic scope. I really enjoyed this film; while there is enough to take issue with it, the film is so grand on many feats. With Russell Crowe happily taking the challenge of centre stage and leading the proceedings under Ridley Scott's firm direction.",SHOW MORE,

,,,"Dec 23, 2020","The story is gold with little knicks here and there with how it’s delivered. That gives people who critique something to do. I recently rewatched it, and it’s been a very long time since the last, and I knew everything that happens and the tone. Even while watching I looked at my phone a few times, BUT - the end still made my eyes swell up. That’s a sign of good storytelling. “Are you not entertained?!” Lol",,
