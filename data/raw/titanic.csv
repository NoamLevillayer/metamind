Finding a nude drawing. Then comes an old woman, who survived the shipwreck. And it's her. Personally I would have left everything down there, and I also prefer men. So, it would have been extremely more interesting to see a nude drawing of Dicaprio. There's also this unbelievable class gap, that of course let the working class people drown. While there's still a chance for the capital owners to survive. The scene with Dicaprio tied up, and the water's rising, I feel is a cheap, suspence thing. I find it also a bit strange that the couple couldn't hold on to the raft together. All in all, it's not inspiring to me.",SHOW MORE,,,

With that out of the way, I say this movie was James Cameron at his peak. With his deep passion and huge ambitions, he crafted a work so timeless, grand, and spellbinding that it still stood nearly 30 years later as a giant in the world of blockbuster filmmaking. It may not be perfect, but it's still a work of great excellence. It's something I don't see Hollywood making ever again.",SHOW MORE,,,

The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx ""movies"" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them.

Under the exceptional direction of James Cameron, this film was crafted with immense passion and dedication. He poured his heart and soul into creating a captivating world that would resonate with audiences for generations to come. Leonardo DiCaprio delivered an outstanding performance as Jack, investing every ounce of his talent into the role. His portrayal was nothing short of extraordinary, especially for a young actor at the time, and it propelled him into stardom, marking a significant turning point in his career. Kate Winslet was equally compelling as Rose, and her role in Titanic set her on the path to becoming a megastar. She left an indelible mark on film history with the iconic line, ""Paint me like one of your French girls,"" ensuring that her performance would be remembered long after the credits rolled. Overall, Titanic is an incredible film that captivates from start to finish.

Set against the backdrop of the RMS Titanic, the movie follows Jack Dawson, a free-spirited artist, and Rose DeWitt Bukater, a young aristocrat trapped in a life of privilege she resents. Their passionate love story unfolds as the cruise of the era, the Titanic ultimately collides with the tragic reality of its sinking. I am in love with the cinematography of this movie. It is breathtaking, capturing the Titanic with remarkable detail. From the lavish first-class dining halls to the engine rooms where the workers toil, every scene is incredibly crafted to transport viewers back to 1912. Everything looks so realistic and in time. The special effects, particularly the scenes of sinking sequence, remain impressive even watching this movie decades later, creating an intense emotion that immerses the audience in the disaster’s chaos. The main actor and actress of this movie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver phenomenal performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their roles. Jack played by DiCaprio is charming, adventurous, and full of life, while Rose played by Winslet is elegantly rebellious, struggling against societal constraints. Their chemistry making the romance and romantic scenes on point. Billy Zane, as Rose’s ruthless fiancé Cal, adds tension with his villainous portrayal, heightening the stakes of the story which I really like. The iconic score of My Heart Will Go On enhances the film’s emotional impact. The music beautifully underscores the highs of Jack and Rose’s romance and the devastation of the ship’s sinking, leaving a lasting impression on viewers. The screenplay strikes a balance between heartfelt moments, thrilling action sequences, and historical authenticity, ensuring that the narrative remains engaging throughout the three-hour runtime of the movie. Beyond its love story, Titanic explores themes of class disparity, fate, and survival. The stark contrast between the privileged first-class passengers and the struggling third-class travelers highlights the extreme social hierarchies of the time. The film’s emotional weight making it more than just a romance. Watching this film is a tragic but unforgettable experience. With its stunning visuals, compelling performances, and emotional depth, Titanic is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences. I love Titanic. This movie is an essential watch.",SHOW MORE,,,

I saw Titanic in 1997, at just 8 years old, in a new cinema in Buenos Aires. At the time, I didn’t fully get the hype, but now, nearly 30 years later, it remains one of my favorites. The story between Rose and Jack has unforgettable moments: Rose’s hand on the fogged window, the villain taking the girl to the lifeboat, and the heartbreaking scene where Rose leaves Jack to freeze. Old Rose’s iconic “It’s been 84 years” line and the dramatic diamond drop are now part of pop culture. Despite its flaws, Titanic still resonates, with emotional highs and a love story that never gets old.",SHOW MORE,,,

At the time I was taken with some of the effects, the great pacing, camera work and editing. And there are some sweet performances and great mis en scene but it's all inadequate to compensate for the maudlin bull during the majority of the film. The pre-collision exterior shots are silly, often amateurish, from the long shot of the vessel gliding along the sea to the burg that looks like a badly made stage piece - a cloud that fell to sea, this time I looked forward to the sinking so this party could be over. But, the last few scenes as the monster begins its dive to the North Atlantic ocean floor is a fun ride.",SHOW MORE,,,

I liked the cool opening in the present day exploring the underwater wreckage work the submarine and framing of the story with old Rose. The cinematography is amazing and makes the Titanic feel larger than life, both warm & heavenly in the first half of the film, and then terrifying and hellish in the second half. The movie has a cool showcase of how the titanic works and how it sank with grand scale. The evil fiancé is entertaining, but admittedly corny. As a Midwesterner, I liked the mice shoutout to Jack talking about being from Wisconsin and its cold winters. The feminism subtext is mostly good, but a little patronizing and old fashioned at times in its 90's execution. There's interesting political reasons for why the Titanic sank because of wanting a shortcut to make headlines for it's speed as well as less life boats for clutter eyesore irony. I actually really liked the cute relationship where Jack saves Rose and she loves his paintings and freedom. The Kathy Bates character is funny and pretty cool. I also liked the cute Irish dancing scene. The movie is a sweet rom-com that turn into an epic and tragic disaster movie. I loved the sweet and intimate painting scene and steamy car scene. I also loved the cool water flooding practical effects. They’rez very exciting and tense with mass panic and grand spectacle. The movie does get a little receptive with the 2nd time Jack & Rose navigate the same flooded hallways after the ex-fiancé goes crazy with a gun with some insane mixed priorities. And there's a morally questionable decision where rose dumps the priceless jewel into the ocean, but still emotionally resonant with her final goodbye to Jack in finding closure. ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dione is iconic, but corny and all I can think of are the memes. But the movie still ends on a very sweet note with some nice subtle photo montage of Rose getting to fulfill her dreams after the Titanic and her heavenly symbolic return to Jack in the final after party of the Afterlife. The movie is titanic in its scale (pun entirely intended) and strikes the perfect balance between sweet & endearing with its character building, as well as the tense and exciting stakes of their survival at the hands of the titular sinking of the vessel that brought them together and changed their lives forever.",SHOW MORE,,,

The film is a blockbuster and is a part of a canon of cinematography. It has many tense scenes and an interesting plot twist. The protagonists who feature in this film are cast by famous actors. The plot narrows down to two characters and their relationship. The tension is high through the whole movie especially after the catastrophe when the ship hits an iceberg. A famous scene shows the drama as the orchestra plays to the Titanic slowly sinking. This film is prime example of a romantic drama.

Some might call it overrated, but it's hard to deny the emotional weight and the sheer craftsmanship that went into making it. Rewatching it reminded me why it's stood the test of time, it's a great mix of story, performances, and technical execution. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver standout performances as Jack and Rose. Their chemistry is natural and believable, and it's what drives the story forward. The drawing scene is iconic for many reasons, both on and off the screen. Interestingly, it wasn't DiCaprio sketching Rose, it was actually James Cameron himself. Cameron, who's also an artist, added a personal touch to the scene by creating the famous drawing. Behind the scenes, Winslet knew the scene could be awkward since it involved nudity and was one of their first together, so she flashed DiCaprio to help him relax. Even with that, he was nervous and flubbed his line, saying, ""Lie on that bed... uh, couch"" instead of just ""couch."" The mistake stayed in the film, and it adds a little authenticity to the moment. Visually, Titanic is impressive on every level. The production design is meticulous. From the luxurious first-class interiors to the gritty third-class quarters, every set looks authentic and lived-in. The cinematography captures both the intimacy of Jack and Rose's relationship and the overwhelming scale of the disaster. The sinking sequence is still one of the most intense and well-executed moments in film. Cameron used a mix of practical effects, real sets, and CGI to recreate the chaos, and it all blends seamlessly. The result is a scene that's visually stunning and emotionally gripping. The final act ties everything together perfectly. Rose's memories, paired with James Horner's haunting score, deliver an emotional gut punch. That last shot is unforgettable and leaves you thinking long after the credits roll. Titanic isn't just about a historical tragedy or a love story, it's a film about human connection and the choices we make when everything's on the line. Cameron's attention to detail, paired with strong performances and excellent storytelling, makes this one of the most impactful films ever made. Overrated? Maybe. But it's a benchmark in filmmaking for a reason.",SHOW MORE,,,

Including best picture and best director. Once this movie was released, it reached the top immediately and captured the hearts of the viewers. It gave people an emotional connection to the disaster. At the time, this movie was by far the most expensive movie! It introduces people to a world where a famous ship still existed. ACTORS Starring “Leonardo DiCaprio” as Jack Dawson and “Kate Winslet” as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Leonardo got 2.5 million, the best male performance, a best actor nomination and a glorious image! Kate Winslet got 2 million, however, she did not win any awards. Fortunately, this is their most successful movie that led them to success! RECOMMENDATION While titanic is a historical masterpiece, it also comes on a deep personal level, capturing the themes of love, loss, and survival.

Yes, I would watch other misses like The Broadway Melody and Around the World in 80 Days over this, although technically this is leagues better. Aside from the special effects, the story is hollow, the characters are bland, and we are stuck with this for over three hours. Plus, this caused movies like Boogie Nights and L.A Confidential to get robbed at the Oscars. I do like James Cameron as a director, especially his earlier films, but this is where he went downhill for me.

Cameron is a genius director whose perfection of his subject and craft cannot be denied. Not sure why it’s now considered “cool” in some circles to deny this movie is spectacular.

Setting out to accurately capture the incident, director James Cameron poured years of research into depicting the event as closely as it played out on that fateful day. Successfully diving to the wreckage of the ship on multiple occasions, Cameron immersed himself with the task of documenting some of the smallest aspects and stories aboard the vessel. While many of the films characters are based on real attendants of the initial voyage, the leads Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) & Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) portray a completely original romantic tale throughout the event. Although the star crossed lovers are no new concept, the performance of the leads, accompanied by Cameron's writing, create one of the most timeless love story ever put to film. Each character beautifully adds to the story and each actor brilliantly embodies the time period and their individual roles in the wider tale. As a spectacle of visual effects, even over 25 years after its release, The Titanic was masterfully constructed to showcase every aspect of the absolutely horrific incident. With nearly every scene being filled with wondrous attraction, the climax resonates as the toll is taken on the emotional journey endured by viewers. Additionally, the companion piece of Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' fits flawlessly into the film and both elevate each others passionate message. James Cameron created a once in a lifetime experience with Titanic and, while capturing the realism of the event, created one of the greatest romances of this era.",SHOW MORE,,,

Cameron does a remarkable job of paying respect to the 1500+ individuals who undeservingly passed away due to what still feels like one of mankind's more recent greatest tragedies and parables. Although the love story may deter some, if one can allow it to sink in (pun not originally intended), it's a poetic piece of fabric woven within the realm of possibilities within a historical event and its many historical accuracies that Cameron goes above and beyond to maintain. The cast, class issues, and sets are all historic. The movie does not shy away from the horror of the incident and puts you right in the mix of a sinking ship as well as in the eyes of a survivor forced to witness the awe and dread of it all. At one point, Rose is staring up at a calm starry sky while hundreds of people around her are in a panicked frenzy to stay alive — something about that dichotomy really struck me as brilliant movie-making within this body of work. I'll never forget the sold out theatres and girls crying out loud throughout the movie, I haven't seen anything quite like it since. With 40 around the corner, the film hits differently. I don't shy away to consider it a masterpiece.",SHOW MORE,,,

James Cameron's 1997 epic weaves a love story into the tragic historical event. The film's grandeur is undeniable, with stunning visuals and a memorable score. However, the romance between Jack and Rose sometimes falls into predictable tropes. The historical accuracy is commendable, but the fictional elements tend to overshadow it. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver compelling performances, elevating the material. While the film's impact is undeniable, its length and occasional melodrama may deter some viewers. Titanic remains a captivating, if flawed, voyage through history and romance.",SHOW MORE,,,

,,,"Dec 19, 2023","After 25 years this is one of director James Cameron’s biggest crowning achievements and still one of the biggest blockbusters ever It's really heartbreaking knowing the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 actually happened in real-life and over 1500 passengers died from drowning next to subfreezing temperatures At the time it was James Cameron's most successful film earning over $2 billion on a $200 million budget and earning 11 Oscars He had the daunting task of working by himself a lot on production with the sets, the miniatures, even the camerawork and effects But he humanized this dramatic telling of one of the most tragic disasters in human history This was my first introduction to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet; they play Jack Dawson and Rose and boasted by a large cast of supporting players Bernard Hill, Francis McCoy, Billy Zane, the late Bill Paxton, the late David Warner, Victor Garber, and Kathy Bates Jack, a poor boy who happened to board the ship to start anew and Rose was born into a prestigious rich lifestyle but feels chained by it having no direction in her life When they both meet they unexpectedly form a romantic attachment seeing how their backgrounds differ so much Jack and Rose learn it isn’t about the money or being on the social ladder Yet Rose is engaged to be married to another man who’s slimy and will do anything to keep Jack from having Rose to himself, even her mother disapproves of Jack’s poor lack of income She becomes a much better character not letting the fire that burns within go out and that’s what Jack loves about her Everything drastically changes after the vessel hits an iceberg causing a tear in the hull and slowly hour by hour it starts to sink putting our leads and other passengers in mortal danger The clock is ticking as Jack and Rose try to make it out alive with everyone else regardless if they were rich or poor The movie made these young stars household names giving birth to endless memes, pop cultural references, and ongoing arguments of their survival This is also the film that gave birth to the hate culture; many people would call it a chick flick and not see past the bigger picture The film does an amazing job though looking at class, wealth, romance, the social ladder, and bravery trying to defy death all at a staggering 3 hours but moves by with ease Celine Dion's song My Heart Will Go On is still one of her most popular hits and she dedicated a lot of the lyrics to her late father James Horner’s music is so sweeping with the right amount of emotion and intensity The movie is filled with stories and themes that stretch from romance to expose, from parables of hubris to celebrations of industry The films social awareness of the disparity between upper and lower class is symbolic of the capitalist, western society in which we live despite predictability and flimsiness It’s important for us to live life liberated by shackles of aristocracy and feeling less constrained But in the end you really do feel for these characters and the natural disaster they find themselves in being very gripping and intense Give Billy Zane credit; even though he came off as an over the top bad guy they still made him almost appear like a genuinely nice person Cameron overlays a grand journey of the human spirit atop all the thrills, spills and clinches And the effects for the sinking of the ship itself still hold up immensely well with physical stunts, CGI, and actual sets built Overall it's a terrific, emotional film part love story, part disaster flick that still highlights the systemic issue that money is power but true love really conquers all",SHOW MORE,,,

It baffles me that people bash on this film just because it became a cultural zeitgeist. Titanic was everywhere and anywhere. People who've never seen movies went to watch it and owned it on VHS/DVD/Blu Ray. People who were cinephiles would go watch it in theaters almost monthly. History on the Titanic got a huge boom of interest and museums began to invest more and teach more on what happened on that fateful day. The movie won 11 Academy Awards, tying the record. It became the biggest box office hit for a while, and the first billion dollar movie. It ran in theaters worldwide for nearly a whole calendar year. And all this, was thanks to the genius and perseverance of a dedicated filmmaker, James Cameron. When the usually R rated content director wanted to make a sweeping PG-13 epic that was gonna be half a romance film and half a disaster film, many looked at him different. But Titanic became a cultural film because it connected with people in many different ways. Not only was it about romance and the ship, but it was also about classism, sexism, ageism, greed, and the bright and dark shades of human nature in desperate times. Its such a deep blockbuster, and one that wasn't designed to have sequels. All of this is encapsulated within one film, and its so impressive that every time you revisit this film, it feels like you enter a journey and are transported to those times. Cameron's film is one of those movie you need to see to believe!",SHOW MORE,,,

It was one of those things everyone saw and defined an era. And it still is amazing how strong this holds up and is an All Time Classic. The special effects are jaw dropping and as much as the CGI is praised, most of this is practical effects and sets. This gives it such a strong tangibility that CGI soaked disaster films or poorly done 70's disaster films don't have. This has epic, lavish, and eye popping moments throughout with the ultimate eye Candy being Jack & Rose's chemistry. Everyone is really good in this but what sends this over the top is those two and Old Rose. Their chemistry and Leo's Charm is amazing. Add on an iconic musical soundtrack for the ages and you can see why this is so strong. The editing is masterful as well as this a mix between a remake of a Night To Remember with a Romance film but never forgets it's a Romance Epic first and stays focused on its leads the whole way never diverting to pointless side characters or subplots and only diverts to tell the factual events of the journey. It never gets sucked into pointless destruction or carnage but always has a purpose and this owes a great debt to A Night to Remember. The only minor issue is the first half is a bit slow mainly because Jack and Rose are apart and not together. Add on the titanic journey telling also and it os slow. However once they meet and their journey's become intertwined it moves much faster and the patience is rewarded with a grand moving ending. Everyone should see this once. I will say remember this is a romance epic more than a factual retelling though it is very faithful to the facts. A Night To Remember is still the best movie for showing purely what happened on the voyage. Watch Both.",SHOW MORE,,,

Zane's portrayal of the arrogant and possessive fiancé, Cal, is nothing short of captivating. He flawlessly embodies the character's entitled demeanor, leaving a lasting impression on the audience with his compelling portrayal of a man consumed by wealth and status. Throughout the movie, Zane's commitment to the role is evident as he brings depth and complexity to Cal, making him more than just a one-dimensional villain. In scenes with Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet's Rose DeWitt Bukater, Zane's commanding presence shines, creating intense and emotionally charged moments that further intensify the movie's central conflict. His interactions with the other characters are riveting, making Cal a formidable force to be reckoned with. Zane's ability to evoke a range of emotions from disdain to sympathy for Cal is a testament to his incredible acting prowess. He portrays the character with such conviction that viewers are both repelled by his actions and intrigued by the inner turmoil he displays. In conclusion, Billy Zane's block-buster performance as Cal Hockley in ""Titanic"" adds a layer of complexity and depth to the film, complementing the gripping love story at its core.

After watching on Blu-Ray, I've gained a new appreciation for it. This is a very long movie, one you may even want to break up into two viewings. It's not the norm, by any means. With that being said, it's not perfect. But it's based on such an important moment in history. I'll be honest, it gets a pass in some ways because of that fact. If it was a movie about a random ship or just a romantic drama in general, it wouldn't have quite the same impact. The movie features excellent performances from DiCaprio and Winslet. Their romance on screen is believable and endearing. The back and forth between that tragic day at sea in 1912 and modern day works well and adds a layer of depth that takes it to another level. The sets of the infamous ship are well designed and it makes you feel like you're there in each moment on board. The iceberg scene and sinking are harrowing to watch. Even though a lot of the story is made up, it adds more drama and entertainment, which is fine with me. Overall, it's a great film from James Cameron.

Review. 1997 Agosto 18 en la espera de una de las historias que mas me llamaba la atención desde que primera vez vi un libro 3D de el Titanic en una tienda de libros de Plaza Las Americas en los 90's. James Cameron luego de entregarnos filmes como Aliens,T2 y True Lies, tuvo el atrevimiento y ese pensamiento ambicioso de hacer una de las historias reales mas conmovedoras en la historia de accidentes de barcos, este fue el caso de el Titanic, protagonizada por Leonardo Dicaprio y Kate Winslet en lo que es la mejor pelicula Dramática y romántica en la historia del cine. Esta ocación fue totalmente diferente, remasterizada a la septima potencia, en Imax por primera vez en la historia y para colmo 3D. Asi fue la experiencia por 10ma vez en una sala del cine... si asi como estas leyendo TITANIC es la pelicula que mas veces e ido al cine en mi vida 9 veces en el 1997 y una ultima vez en Imax 25 años despues en su aniversario en el mismo momento donde The Way of Water sigue haciendo historia, ahora vamos a lo que tanto espere hacer. El 12 de abril de 1912, el gigante ""insumergible"" RMS Titanic partió en su viaje inaugural desde Southampton, Inglaterra, para nunca volver a ver tierra y arrastrando más de 1.500 almas hasta el fondo del océano con él. La historia de Cameron cuenta una historia dentro de la historia original, uno de los personajes es Rose, una joven criada por una rica familia. La historia es contada como un flashback por esta misma mujer, ahora anciana, en la actualidad, a medida que se descubren artefactos del Titanic en el fondo del mar, esta mujer ve algo que una vez le perteneció. Se reúne con el equipo de exploración del Titanic para compartir sus recuerdos del viaje en el Titanic hasta el trágico día en que se hundió el barco. A partir de ahí, Kate Winslet interpreta el papel de la joven Rose. También entra en escena Leonardo DiCaprio como Jack, un joven pobre con un don para las artes. Él y Rose se encuentran inesperadamente y gradualmente se enamoran. No es nada original, pero la dirección es conmovedora. Realmente llegas a conocer a ambos personajes y quieres que estén juntos. Un romance como este necesita conflicto para que sea interesante.Ciertamente hay mucho de eso. Viene en la forma del prometido de Rose, Cal protagonizado por Billy Zane, nos enseña las diferencias de clase entre ella y Jack. Me encanta la historia romántica de esta película, pero lo que merece una mención más detallada son los efectos especiales. El amor y el desastre se encuentran, y no me refiero solo a la trama. En otras palabras, Titanic es un híbrido de película romántica y película de desastres. Esta es una mezcla inusual e irregular de géneros, pero sorprendentemente funciona muy bien. Si lo piensas bien, el peligro que implica el hundimiento lento del Titanic añade más conflicto al amor que florece al final de la película. No es solo un regalo para los ojos. Aún así, las escenas que tienen lugar una vez que el barco choca contra un iceberg son tan asombrosamente realistas que rivalizan con escenas de películas de desastres más orientadas al suspenso y la acción. Como era de esperar, esta es una película romántica y llena de suspenso, ya sea por separado o simultáneamente. En la superficie, parecen dos películas diferentes pegadas en el medio, pero en realidad son lo mismo en la segunda mitad. Fue una experiencia cinematográfica increíble. Es una de esas historias cinematográficas de las que no puedes quitar los ojos de encima. La mejor manera de concluir esta reseña es mencionar al director. James Cameron, conocido por dirigir The Terminator,Avatar y The Way of Water,Aliens,True Lies y The Abyss, trae una magia cinematográfica similar a Titanic pero agrega un toque igual de romance, algo que nunca esperé de este director. El resultado es una película de la que podría estar realmente orgulloso y que los fanáticos podrían disfrutar una y otra vez por decadas. Sin dejar atras la mejor canción en el universo ""My Heart Will Go On"" por Celine Dion y recordarles que fue nominada a 14 Oscars ganando 11 de ellos incluyendo Terminando mi enorme Review les dire que esto fue un espectaculo audiovisual y tuve que esperar 25 años para poder hablar de esta manera de Titanic en Imax y en un Review, definitivamente Titanic es el mejor filme en la categoria Drama en la historia.

This movie has it all. A tremendous score, deep emotion emphasized by fantastic performances, and incredibly gripping and high-stakes action. There is really something for everyone here. Before I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch. Back to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me. The performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton. This film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well. Overall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it. Score: 96% Verdict: Masterpiece On a side note: I did see this movie in 3D during the twenty-five-anniversary re-release. While it was great to see it remastered in 4K, I do think the 3D was poor and unneeded. This did not affect my grade however, since it was not originally designed as a 3D experience, and they 3D did not really take away for my enjoyment.",SHOW MORE,,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/WYdF8WIDVFG9T9GIWRH8riRnTGN,,,"May 8, 2022","Titanic is, in general, a very heart-breaking movie. Although it is known for the romance and the two famous stars on the movie posters, Titanic has a historical background that is also very interesting to be observed and taken into consideration. Rose was being forced to marry someone she hated to save her family from economical disgrace, Jack was treated with despise when he was among the wealthy people on the ship, and, in the end, the poor people (many of whom were people of color too) were left to die while the boats were being filled with the aristocrats. I've watched this movie dozens of times but I always manage to get very teary. In my opinion, both of the protagonists are charismatic (specially Jack, my beloved), and I love their scene on the ship's bow because the soundtrack and the photography are great. Of course I would be way happier now if jack had not died, but we can't have everything so I accepted his fate. I don't think the movie is completely perfect because you can always find things that are susceptible to criticism (it is still white-centered, for example). However, I still recommend this movie even though it is really old and everyone might have already heard about it, but for those who haven't: that's a unique experience you are missing out on.",SHOW MORE,,,

There really aren't these kind of universally shared cinematic experiences anymore, as even Marvel movies are ignored by large segments of the population, and certainly the three hour sweeping historical dramas are out (sorry Ridley). Titanic provided a much more comforting rewatch all these years later and it had been awhile as this maybe the first rewatch I haven't had to switch VHS cassettes halfway through. I could easily make a case for Leo and Kate as my favorite actor and actress since this film, as I went on to appreciate so much more of their work. Cameron creates a visually stunning film, the scope of which still looks and feels just as impressive today. The strong nostalgia as well as the factors listed above make it easier to look past some of the stilted dialogue and implausible plot choices, but even judging this film on a purely technical level, I think it would still be hard to get me more than a star lower. 9.5/10 Side note: I never appreciated until this watch that Rose Dawson may have also been the finest art collector the world has ever seen.",SHOW MORE,,,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/RkXFJQIlYFY6inLh4RfQRIBYfAd,,,"Feb 4, 2022","Summary: In 1912, a huge and fancy cruise, the Titanic, was voyaging from England to New York. It was a cruise that carried people's dream of new life in America. There is also a romantic story that happened on the cruise. There are two main characters in the movie, Jack and Rose. Jack was born in a poor family. He won the Titanic's tickets from a bar. He was full of dreams and was excited about having a new life in America. Rose was born into a wealthy family. However, her family went broke a few years ago. Her mom wanted to maintain a wealthy life, she wanted Rose to marry a rich guy who Rose doesn't love. Rose was reluctant to get married to him and she decided to jump off the boat to kill herself. However, Jack walked by and saved her. At first, Rose wasn't happy about Jack saving her life. For Rose, a life of pretending to be rich seemed superficial to her. She almost felt suffocated in life like this. Jack's appearance was a beam from the sun to her foggy heart. Jack showed to Rose that even the people who lived in the third class were not rich, but they owned the real happiness. Meanwhile, Jack and Rose got to have more chances to stay with each other, and they fell in love. While they were dreaming for their future in America, they didn't know that the danger was getting closer to them. Analysis: Titanic is a movie with romance and history. It is adapted from a real story. All the story starts from Rose's memory in the Titanic. By recalling the scene, it brings the audience back to 1920. Through highly restored scenes from the Titanic, the audiences can experience the life on the Titanic. I think Titanic was popular at that time for three reasons: fancy special effects, the romantic story, and that it was based on a real story. Wallace Hartley was a real violinist who played with his band their last song on the Titanic and in their lives. That is the most unforgettable scene for me: while the boat was sinking, the violinists started to play ‘Nearer, My God, to Thee' on the cabin. They didn't rush to try to get a spot from the rescue boat, instead they chose to play this music to calm down people. Here are two different aspects of why they chose to play this song. Firstly, the song can bring people peace. Secondly, the song mentions the coming death, and it acted like a funeral song because most of the people would die because of lack of rescue boats. Through playing this song, people can realize that death is not the end and God is always watching over his people, and they would be able to meet God and their beloved one. Eventually, the violinists sacrificed their lives for playing music to the people. Titanic is not just a movie but also a society, it shows people from different social statuses experiencing that disaster together. There are heroes and villains. The violinists are heroes. Their music brought the Spirit and peace to the boat, and they even all sacrificed themselves in the end. Critic/Recommendation: I think Titanic is an awesome movie, not only because of its reality but also based on what they wanted to share with the audiences. Titanic is a romantic movie with a disastrous ending. In addition, I think the director is good at mixing every element in the movie. As I mentioned before, the Titanic is not just a cruise, it also represents a society. Through people's words and actions, I can learn from history and experience the love between Jack and Rose. The special effects were a hit at that time. When the movie came out, special effects were not as common as now, also most people have never been into that background of the early 20th century. The movie lets them have the chance to experience life at that time which can make the audience more involved in the movie while watching it. Even after twenty-two years have passed its special effects are still a legend. Due to its perfect story and fantastic special effects, I rate it 5/5 stars. I highly recommend people go watch the movie.",SHOW MORE,,,

From the hate angle, it feels deeply unsettling to use a horrific maritime disaster as the platform for a love story involving the dashingly handsome artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the wealthy but dissatisfied Rose (Kate Winslet). In addition, like so many Hollywood epics, it tends to drag on much longer than it needs to. On the love side, there's nothing else quite like it. It's a well-executed and thoroughly engaging exploration of the struggle between the classes and the idea of enduring, eternal love that will draw the viewer into the drama regardless of whether the audience wants to be drawn in or not.",SHOW MORE,,,

Not one person survived with a Third Class ticket. The rich negotiate, offer leverage, hide in spacious lifeboats and Rose survives instead of Jack. This is an accurate story but should be received as a tragedy instead of a romance. What lines of memorable dialogue are there? They pass the plot along, the ship must sink.

As I start this ""Re-watching and Re-visiting films"" series, I will be repeating this many times. I do not quite get people's issue and ""beef"" (to put it less sophisticated) with Titanic. Is it one of the best movies of all time? Not quite. Is it a really well-done film that stays in our minds years and years after seeing it for the first time and if it is playing on a TV channel, you put it on? Why, yes. I understand the bother with a ""pointless"" love story plot line for dramatization but what's funny is that it works with the strong performances and magical chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. But what I want to focus on in Titanic is the little scenes. There are many scenes where the tears uncontrollably fall down your face. Towards more the last section of the film where the boat officially sunk down, there is a shot from sky above of all the passengers screaming and flapping around the water. Up close, it is suffocating hysteria and from afar, it is just one sound in the middle of the gigantic ocean. People being left to die (as there are themes being shown of the lower class being purposely cast aside and the rich prioritized) and people coming to terms this might be their last breath on earth.

Is it overrated, absolutely. But there is still such a great nature to it that makes it honestly hard not to love (at least slightly). The first 90 minutes of the movie is essentially just a chick flick (and the writing is not the best) but it has such a charm to it and Leo and Kate’s chemistry is so likable that you can’t help but enjoy it (even if it isn’t the best). Then the rest becomes a completely different movie almost, as we see the titanic sink. This is where the movie really becomes phenomenal. The effects done and the cinematography and shots we get are great. Even though I’ve never really liked James Cameron much as a person you deny that he is a great director, especially with action scenes like the end to the movie.

There had long been a definitive, historically accurate movie about the ship sinking and there had even been one where a love story is told while the ship sank as a backdrop. The good news is that this knowledge didn't really sully my experience at all; they did a FAR greater job here at capturing the sense of wonder that the ship provided its passengers, the love story was more compelling, they took the right creative liberties by creating high-quality antagonists and they did a better job creating a sense of foreboding with the sinking alluded to throughout the runtime. The main thing I disliked was the way they framed the narrative as nearly all of it felt clumsy, from the Old Rose narration sounding like she was reading off a piece of paper to the treasure hunting guy having conflicting attributes with his clearly-expensive effort to dig up artifacts trumped by knowledge he would've had beforehand, that some ship passengers loved each other. The movie would fall a bit short from a purely technical standpoint but it's still one of the greatest viewing experiences ever provided by film as a medium, so I'm giving it the full score here.

It baffles me that people bash on this film just because it became a cultural zeitgeist. Titanic was everywhere and anywhere. People who've never seen movies went to watch it and owned it on VHS/DVD/Blu Ray. People who were cinephiles would go watch it in theaters almost monthly. History on the Titanic got a huge boom of interest and museums began to invest more and teach more on what happened on that fateful day. The movie won 11 Academy Awards, tying the record. It became the biggest box office hit for a while, and the first billion dollar movie. It ran in theaters worldwide for nearly a whole calendar year. And all this, was thanks to the genius and perseverance of a dedicated filmmaker, James Cameron. When the usually R rated content director wanted to make a sweeping PG-13 epic that was gonna be half a romance film and half a disaster film, many looked at him different. But Titanic became a cultural film because it connected with people in many different ways. Not only was it about romance and the ship, but it was also about classism, sexism, ageism, greed, and the bright and dark shades of human nature in desperate times. Its such a deep blockbuster, and one that wasn't designed to have sequels. All of this is encapsulated within one film, and its so impressive that every time you revisit this film, it feels like you enter a journey and are transported to those times. Cameron's film is one of those movie you need to see to believe!",SHOW MORE,,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/1KkFeOIx6uplfxPF6pidAS2mIQe,,,"Mar 15, 2021","Cameron's exquisite attention to detail in regards to the sets, costumes and of course the innovative CGI is what makes this film work. Also helping it along is the wonderful Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack. She and Leo DiCaprio have amazing chemistry together as the fictional couple from different worlds. The way that sci-fi and horror director Cameron turns the Titanic into a monster when it hits the iceberg is something to see - the last fifteen minutes of the sinking is awesome to watch. What doesn't work? With so many amazing real life stories of the passengers and crew of the famous ship, James Cameron decides not just to ignore them, but create a rather foolish and preposterous tale about a missing diamond and filling out the supporting cast with cliched, silent film type characters (the snooty mother, an odious fiancé, a greedy publicity hungry shipping magnate) which takes away from the natural power of the famous shipwreck. Billy Zane is particularly bad here in a Snidely Whiplash-esque turn here as Rose's fiancé Cal Hockley, complete with an equally nefarious sidekick/right hand man played by David Warner. And Frances Fisher as Rose's mercenary mother Ruth, gives an icy, one-dimensional performance, like a scheming matriarch in a nighttime soap opera. Fisher is a much better actress than that. And Kathy Bates is criminally wasted as Molly Brown, who was probably the ballsiest passenger onboard. Her presence is muted here, but Bates works with what she's got. And the crew and second class passengers are pretty much ignored. We are left with the wealthy, entitled and elitist first class passengers and the naive, plucky and resourceful immigrants in third class. No one else counts. I also like Bill Paxton in his role as the fortune hunter Brock. But the film is infectious fun despite its glaring flaws; it's impossible to not get caught up in the sheer spectacle, from the treasure hunters using cutting edge technology to inspect the Titanic's rusty bones, to the excitement of a glamorous ocean liner making its maiden voyage, to the tragically dramatic wreck. The film still manages to impress.",SHOW MORE,,,

This movie is not just a romantic movie, it also portrays a lot of drama stories. The movie shows us that love and suitability are not the same thing. Jack and Rose's Love, people disagree, but in the end it can cause love anyway. There was one scene that I'm quite shocked when the boat was sinking, people were selfish tried to get on the reserve boat to survive, let the rich get on the reserve boat first, then the poor later. I watched this scene and felt depressed, that measure the value of people with money, there are two impressive scenes :1.Jack and Rose falling from a boat while the ship sank, which had to be in very cold water that there were a lot of deaths from the cold water in this scene, but Jack told Rose ""you had to stay alive"". In the end, someone came to help keep Rose alive, but Jack couldn't endure the cold so he died, which made me cry a lot. 2.when the boat was sinking, a couple of old men and women choose to end their lives cuddling and die together, I'm impressive and sad at the same time.

To this day, I have no idea why it was such a success. But at least it gave the world Kate Winslet.

A wonderful story about the ship called the titanic and a girl named Rose played by Kate Winslet falls in love with Jack played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The acting in the movie is very good. I loved it. I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. He's a great actor. The part where Leonardo DiCaprio dies towards the end is very sad. I recommend checking out titanic.

In my eyes, this is an instant classic with a very sad script, as one could expect.

The relationship between Jack and Rose is very well acted and thus the long runtime, the development of the story, and their characters is done really well. Once the Titanic crashes, the action is impeccable. While still capturing Jack and Rose's romance, you get to see a near accurate depiction of the Titanic sinking. As the climax builds, you get to see the panic that spreads throughout the ship. I would definitely recommend this film, especially to anybody who likes historical dramas and natural disaster films. Also, the depiction of the rich and poor and how they interact with each other is a common theme throughout the movie, which provides a consistent moral throughout the movie which is very neat as well. Titanic is a great movie, that deserves 5 stars.",SHOW MORE,,,

Not only does Titanic prove how skilled and elegant Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is and the sensational direction skills by James Cameron, but is retells the story of the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic with total and full command; as the tense athmosphere breaks through its windows and its emotional weight is staggering. A film that takes you on an adventure and pours doses of romance and really makes you care about every living soul that perished 15. April 1912.

,,,"Oct 25, 2020","I don't know how to feel about this. On the one hand, I loved a lot of things. I loved DiCaprio and Winslet in the film. They give great performances. Billy Zane is a ton of fun to watch. At some points you hate him, but there are times where you feel sympathetic to him. But by the end you hate him. Also Kathy Bates and Victor Garber. Love them. They are awesome. I loved the effects. Still very convincing. However as per usual with James Cameron, I don't like that much of the story. The first half is very cliché. It's your standard romance that you've seen a million times. But it does it well. I had fun with the it. But it was very standard and the script wasn't very good. Throughout the whole film. It's not the worst, but it feels kinda 90s. But the second half is where the real indifference is. On the one hand, it looks great. Some of the things are pretty awesome. And while I hated the fact that I was horrified and had a ton of anxiety. But that was on intentional. But something about it felt wrong. If this wasn't real I wouldn't have felt as bad. But it felt a bit to dark and exploitive for my taste.",SHOW MORE,,,

Sometimes I'll step out into the water there, plant my feet, and pretend I'm a post. My girlfriend holds on to my back like she's a barnacle. In fact, I'm a plant, and she's a plant. I love her so much. Sometimes when I can't sleep I'll nudge up next to her so I can feel her chest expand and contract with her breath. It's comforting. Sleep barnacle.
