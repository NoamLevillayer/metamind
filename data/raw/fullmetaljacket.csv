I first act of the film is the strongest, which some might consider a flaw. Vincent D'Onofrio really knocked it out of the park as Private Pile in what is quite possibly his career best performance. Before he got this role, he had gotten himself in the best shape of his life only to be offered a part in a Stanley Kubrick film, which was a dream for any actor in the world while Mr. Kubrick was still making films. He gained some 40 pounds only for Stanley to tell him that he just looks ""like he could kick everybody's ass here"". That meant he had to gain another 30 pounds to look like the pathetic Private Pile that Kubrick had in mind. He gained the weight, got the part, and the rest is history! Lee Ermey was born to play Gunnery Sergeant L. Hartman. He, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Matthew Modine absolutely owned the opening scene. Modine was exceptional in his role as Private Joker. Full Metal Jacket being a 1980s Vietnam War film, the comparisons to Platoon are inevitable. Oliver Stone's Platoon came out in 1986, and I consider it to be a masterpiece. Personally, I think it is the better film of the two, but Full Metal Jacket is certainly the more well-made, more professionally crafted film. Any critic can see the master at work in the finer details of the picture. Of course, Oliver Stone is a great filmmaker in his own right, but I'm sure even he would admit that Stanley Kubrick was the best or one of the top 2 or 3 in the history of cinema. I love Joker's thousand yards stare at the end of the movie. The film ends on an analytical note, appropriate for a combat correspondent. I most definitely recommend it. 94/100",SHOW MORE,,

Este primer acto es excelente y se me hace muy superior a todo lo demás, ya que se nos muestra el entrenamiento de unos soldados y como son explotados por su sargento hasta que uno cae en la locura; es un acto genial que te genera muchas cosas. Por otro lado, la otra parte de la película en la que ya es la guerra es un poco mas lenta y no se me paso tan rápido como lo anterior pero si me gusto mucho, aunque quizás es porque ya venia de ver el primer acto que esta a un nivel muy alto y esperaba algo parecido. También hay que destacar las actuaciones que son geniales, principalmente las de R.

'Full Metal Jacket' is not bad by any means, it just feels inconsistent between the two parts it consists of. The first part, being the military training, is wildly entertaining, hilarious, and yet somber and concluded on a truly depraved note.

The first half follows U.S. Marines recruits as they train in a boot camp located in South Carolina and focuses on two privates nicknamed ""Joker"" and ""Pyle"" played by Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio, respectively. The film then switches to American soldiers including Joker as they actively fight in the Vietnam War. A crucial and captivating aspect of the film is the acting. Matthew Modine's portrayal of Joker as a quick-witted and morally grey character grounds the film and even helps balance the small bits of comedy with the harsh representation of war. Modine is skillful as he is able to switch from the squad's class clown to a serious Marine, who is fighting to stay alive while keeping his morals in check. Modine's best scene, in my opinion, is near the end revolving around the sniper. Just through his face alone, you can tell that Joker is going through a variety of thoughts and emotions as he's struggling with a hard choice to make. After doing so, his expression changes to capture the pain of war and how Joker has finally felt the true meaning of it. Another standout in the film is Vincent D'Onofrio as Pyle. Pyle is a slow-minded recruit but is also one of the more interesting and complex characters present in the film. In one of the more powerful and dramatic scenes in the whole movie which closes the first part, D'Onofrio shines as Pyle reaches a breaking point and chooses to fight back against his mistreatment, despite choosing the wrong way to go about it. It is a difficult one to watch thanks to D'Onofrio as the audience can empathize with him and what he goes through but at the same time, doesn't want him to go down the wrong path. You can feel Pyle's emotions boiling up to the surface through D'Onofrio's facial expressions and line delivery which drives home the uncomfortableness of the scene. As someone who doesn't really enjoy war movies, this one was no different. Although there were many parts of the film that interested me such as splitting it into two parts and the well-written characters, it was enough to win me over. I don't see myself recommending this movie to young viewers like myself as it was definitely a difficult watch from start to finish. However, it can be a good movie to watch for those interested in filmmaking and films in general as the writing and acting were the strongest parts in my opinion. I doubt I'll ever rewatch it again as it just wasn't for me. Overall, I would rate ""Full Metal Jacket"" 3.5/5 stars.",SHOW MORE,,

His signature style is on full display. The plot revolves around the Vietnam War and follows recruits through basic training and ultimately into war. During basic training we see the most iconic Drill Sergeant ever to appear on film preparing and molding his recruits for war. He is also trying to weed out the weak for their own good. He finds his target and then unleashes the most horrific psychological and physical torment ever portrayed on film. It is very difficult to view without feeling remorse for the target and respect for the Drill Sergeant. After basic training the plot follows the main character nicknamed Joker which is appropriate. Joker understands the duplicity of man and the absurdity of war. He is sent into war as a journalist but in the end becomes a product of the violence and environment he is submerged in. The platoon marches away from the battlefield singing in unison a song which this viewer believes Kubrick shot in order to convey his commentary on war and violence. The plot is dark, gritty, disturbing, violent and horrifying. This film has so many unforgettable scenes and dialogue.

It wears its themes on its sleeve and while the idea of showing the military brainwashing and dehumanization tactics in basic training that lead to broken people with guns leading a death parade in a country they know nothing about is fantastic, it only executes upon a percentage of this. The first half of the movie is intriguing with stellar performances and is iconic for a reason, but when the story transitions to Vietnam, it's frankly awful having to watch these guys ""do war."" They are disorganized, immature, selfish, and lacking humanity. Of course, in part it being awful to watch is the point. But moreover, the movie itself becomes disorganized and lacking humanity as well. It feels like a series of short stories with some being much more effective than others bookended by a random terrible narrator desperately hoping to pull it altogether. FMJ is ultimately interesting as it pulls off its darkly ironic tone. It's a story of men who don't know who they are, what they want, or how even how to be human. Are they to blame? Is the military to blame? The movie doesn't outright tell us, but it strongly suggests there's plenty of blame to go around.",SHOW MORE,,

The second half of the movie, set in NAM during the onset of TET, was surprisingly ordinary, especially when compared to the rousing first half, although it begins promisingly enough with the half French, half Vietnamese hooker, immortalizing Me Love You Long Time to the tune of Nancy Sinatra's BOOTS. Since most of the NAM scenes take place in Saigon, Kubrick missed a golden opportunity to accentuate the urban inter-social elements, instead of the rather mundane battle sequences I suppose he was preprogrammed to follow from a book standpoint (never read it). 4.5 Stars though, for the unforgettable first half, and the promise of what could have been.",SHOW MORE,,

Directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick, this film explores the dehumanizing effects of war on soldiers, through the lens of the Vietnam War. The film is split into two distinct parts - the first follows a group of young Marine recruits as they undergo intense training under the watchful eye of the merciless Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, played brilliantly by R. Lee Ermey. This segment is a tour de force of filmmaking, with Ermey's commanding presence and the intense physicality of the training exercises creating an unforgettable and often unsettling experience for the viewer. The second half of the film follows the same group of soldiers as they are deployed to Vietnam, and here Kubrick expertly conveys the chaos and horror of war. The scenes of combat are visceral and intense, with Kubrick's signature long takes immersing the viewer in the action. The standout performance in this segment comes from Vincent D'Onofrio, who plays the troubled and ultimately tragic Private Pyle with an eerie intensity. Full Metal Jacket is a film that is not afraid to confront the darker aspects of war and the human psyche. It's a powerful and thought-provoking work that continues to captivate audiences decades after its initial release. From the iconic ""This is my rifle"" scene to the haunting closing shot, every moment of this film is a testament to Kubrick's masterful storytelling and filmmaking skills.",SHOW MORE,,

The takes are long and filled with lengthy tracking shots, slow zooms and methodical pans, all traits of his later work. Dealing with the devastating dehumanization of war on its participants, the film is essentially told in two parts – Marine basic training followed by combat in Vietnam. The first portion features powerful performances by R. Lee Ermey as the sadistic Sergeant Hartman and Vincent D'Onofrio as the object of Hartman's abuse while the second half deals with Private Joker (Matthew Modine), a Marine journalist covering the war at the time of the Tet Offensive. Where does the film falter? Not for one second does the film look or feel like Vietnam, despite the dying palm trees spread around the shooting locations.

I will be completely honest. My ratings for Full Metal Jacket went up and down like a rollercoaster ride while viewing. It started as a 4 ; then going up to a 5 to only later drop to a 4.5; the 4.5 became a 3 but don't panic! My rating ended in a 4.5. I still cannot decipher why I cannot give it a full 5 but forget numbers. Full Metal Jacket is officially in the top 5 of Kubrick films. War films are nothing new but it's how you make something repetitive look new where you find cinema. He captures the dehumanization of a man in war. Every scene has an important message and we see a blend of cynical humor, (surprisingly) heart, and disaster all in one. Full Metal Jacket does a full damn circle. Raftman begins timid, not really getting in on the war action until the end when he kills the sniper. He yells loud and proud with curse words how happy he is for murdering the enemy. Joker expresses his desire to shoot a gun at an early age yet he's conflictive thoughout the film, whether it's not wanting to join in on the soap-beating of Private Pyle or leaving the sniper to die on her own. Animal is known as this rock with zero f**ks, a killing machine yet we almost see this as a facade of a man who is suffering on the inside from the war and whether or not he shows it, there's still some human in him. Pyle is an interesting character. We experience the slow destruction of a human finishing in the climatic bathroom scene. It's the ending for me. One can't help but chuckle to soldiers marching by burning buildings while singing a Mickey Mouse chant. But, the laughter is short because it is actually chilling. These men still are ""kids,"" who went into a controversial and unnecessary war extremely soon in their lives and in the process lost a huge chunk of their being, yet there is still a tiny percentage of childhood left in them. Talk about an ending. Also, one can't help but hear Gunnery Sergeant's Hartman voice saying, ""What is this Mickey Mouse horseshit?!

The plot of the film follows American soldiers from their first time army train camps to their horrifying experiences in the Vietnam war. The film is distinctively divided in two parts, the first, where we are presented the difficul times of some soldiers named Gomer Pyle, Joker, Animal Mother etc. in an army camp, and their training by psychotic Gunnery Seargant Hartman (R.L. Ermey, in what I believe to be one of the greatest acting achievements in film and some of the best character acting on the screen, I cannot get enough of him) up until the murder of Hartman by Gomer Pyle, who lost his mind after incessant bullying by his peer and harsh training, and the latter's suicide. Up until the ending of the first part, the film maintained a rather dark comical tone, with some harrowing moments, but overall excellent improv by Ermey. The second part of the film follows the soldiers in an attempt to fight off Vietnamese troops, and despite losing friends, they manage to clear the area, but with serious casualties, such as their mental health (important to note that the camera always follows Private Joker and the repercussions war has had on him). The characteristic ending follows the soldiers in a burning landscape marching to their base while singing the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse song, quite ironic, innit. I have nothing but praise for everything, from the carefully adapted screenplay that takes a rather cliche story and elevates it to a whole new level, to technical achievements such as cinematography, art direction, editing and art direction, the sigature Kubrick direction and amazing work from the cast. Only complaint is that after the end of the first part, the tone of the film shifts so suddenly that it takes a while to get used to it, it just feels like the two parts are two different movies. But overall, great film, possibly one of the most darkly comical, harrowing, hard hitting, best examples of war cinema to come out in the 80s.

Kubrick's take on Vietnam is filled with amazing cinematography, great performances, and an anti-war message. The movie almost feels like two separate films with one showing the boot camp experience and the psychological toll is can take on recruits. The second is about the experience of soldiers in Vietnam. You never feel too invested in the characters, as little is fleshed out about who they are and why we should care. It ends on a somewhat anti-climactic and melancholy note, showing the pointlessness of war and the cost it takes in human lives. My main gripe is that it never truly ""feels"" like we are in Vietnam, due to the fact that it was shot in England with only a few imported palm trees to maintain the illusion. Too much gray and not enough green jungle to really make it look like Vietnam rather than a set in near London.

This movie is one that embodies all of these characteristics and then some. If you want to be a person who feels smart by quoting a bad movie then by all means use this one. But if you'd rather go with a movie that was done better, had a clearer message, and is much less embarrassing to quote, go with Platoon or Apocalypse Now. But stop pretending like Kubrick was good at this. He wasn't.",SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/LrOFxGIlwIP8FYQFJnHNXIoxIvo,,,"Jun 13, 2019","It's hard to evaluate this film on it's own merits when considering the fact that one of the greatest directors of all time, Stanley Kubrick, made it and I recently saw The Deer Hunter (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979). I will try to do that however as I still feel that divorced from the specter of those two elements this film doesn't completely work. I wasn't as disturbed as I should have been and I felt that a lot of the acting aimed for the sort of over the top pastiche that became iconic in a lot of Kubrick's other films but didn't quite reach it. It's not on the level of Barry Lyndon (1975) or A Clockwork Orange (1971) but it's unfair to ask for that level of quality with most films. This isn't a much watch unlike Kubrick's other work and I would recommend that you watch most of his other films before venturing to see this one. Private Joker, Matthew Modine, and Gomer Pyle, Vincent D'Onofrio, go through boot camp under the tutelage of Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann, R. Lee Ermey. Hartmann proves to be extremely tough and he turns all of the recruits against Pyle due to his being overweight which causes him to be physically and emotionally abused and ultimately commit a violent act. We jump forward to 1968 in the second half of the film as we see Joker become a journalist for The Stars and Stripes who write military propaganda. His relatively carefree life is interrupted when an attack on his marine base and he and other writers are left to defend themselves amongst the rubble. Eventually they discover that the sniper who murdered one of their friends is just a little girl but Joker is still pushed to kill her at her own request. The scenes in the film that work best are, in my opinion, those that come in the second half of the film. The first half felt like it was stealing from Catch-22 (1970) and MASH (1970) with the satirical elements it incorporated and while Ermey's performance is deserving of it's iconic status I felt he was a touch overused. The second half settled down a little and chose to satirize propaganda and then show the dark effects of the war on innocent people. I was emotionally impacted by the scenes that feature people being devastated by warfare and while other films show death and destruction better Kubrick at least shows he can make a film in which he is emotionally engaged. This may be a controversial opinion because I understand that a lot of people are big fans of the first half while they think the second drops into mediocrity, I would still tend to disagree. I suppose another thing I felt was missing from this film was an interesting visual style. Every other Kubrick film looks amazing and you feel as though the director has focused each shot intensely in an attempt to execute his outlandish vision. Cinematographer Douglas Milsome also worked on three of Kubrick's other films so he clearly knows how to make a film look beautiful but this film just looks sort of blah. Even Platoon (1986) looks better than this film and I have many problems with that film relating to how the director deals with the material he is working with. Not every film needs to look incredible to be affecting but a large part of the reason why Kubrick films are so brilliant are their visuals and you expect to see something new and exciting on the screen every time you watch one of his films. In the end I would say that this film is worth watching even if it's not a masterpiece because it's still post Paths of Glory (1957) Kubrick and we should treasure his work as he only provided us with a few great films but truly great ones at that. I am going to watch the only Kubrick film I have not seen this afternoon and I hope that it is better than this film but if it were on the same level I would still be able to appreciate it in some ways because it would still be better than most films.",SHOW MORE,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/1KkFeOIxjIplfxOu6RfdRs2diQj,,,"Oct 14, 2018","Stanley Kubrick has made many movies that people either love or hate, A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut, movies that are not very popular but are liked by some people, Barry Lyndon, Dr. Strangelove, Paths of Glory, and there are his movies that everyone pretty much loves, The Shining, and the movie I will be reviewing today, Full Metal Jacket. I picked this up at my local library on blu ray and watched it on a friday night. On the way home, my dad asked me what movie I got, I showed him the blu ray, and he was like ""that's a very good movie"" and yeah that was all. Watching Full Metal Jacket, it didn't remind me of other good war films I've seen. It was very different from Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk, Hacksaw Ridge, it is really unique, probably the most unique war film I've ever seen. The storytelling and the elements in the story about the Vietnam war really made it raw. That's how I'd describe the movie, raw. R. Lee Ermey really gave one of the best performances in history in this movie, in my opinion. Even though he was on screen for about 15 minutes, he made those 15 minutes so intense, so great, and gives the movie dark comedic scenes. I think his performance as Sgt. Hartman is one of the best performances of all time. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as a private that struggles in the beginning of the movie because of military training camp being too hard for him, and R. Lee Ermey's character being a hard mentor, challenging Vincent D'Onofrio's character physically and mentally, it is really compelling stuff. The part where he shoots Sgt. Hartman, then shoots himself, is one of the most jaw dropping scenes of all time. The look on Vincent D'Onofrio's face in that scene haunted me for the rest of that night. There is also another main character in this movie named Joker, (that's his nickname). He is in this military camp with Vincent D'Onofrio's character, and he goes through this camp, watching horrific things happen, you really get into the shoes of this character. The next acts of this movie is Joker going to Vietnam and experiencing the war. This part of the movie was really different from the first part back on Parris Island. A lot of people thought this 2nd part of the movie was not as good as the first part, but I thought both parts were great. The Vietnam war was portrayed so rough and raw in this movie, it was pretty breathtaking. The message/allegory of this story was so beautiful and 100% true, it really makes me look at war differently. The only issue I have with this movie is that I thought the movie really dragged at the middle of the film. Not much things were going on, there wasn't really much of a direction either, it just kind of felt like the story was going nowhere. Other than that, I thought this movie was really good. 9/10",SHOW MORE,,

La pellicola è una di quelle in cui la storia è si importante ma la cosa più rilevante è il messaggio, la critica, che il regista vuole lanciare. In questo caso Kubrick si scaglia contro la guerra e l'addestramento militare che trasformano l'uomo in una macchina di morte, fatta solo per uccidere e infatti lo possiamo cogliere nel finale quando Joker uccide la ragazzina e i suoi compagni gli dicono di essere un ""duro"", o anche nel momenti in cui i personaggi difendono la base e nel mentre scherzano tra di loro. Il personaggio più umano è quello di Matthew Modine, ovvero Joker, e nonostante questo anche lui è diventato una macchina, non è più un uomo. Bellissimo il fatto che sull'elmetto, quindi sul cervello, avesse la scritta ""Born to kill"" e sul cuore avesse una spilla che rappresentava la pace. È stato bravissimo, ma Vincent D'Onofrio (Palla di lardo) e R. Lee Ermey (Sergente Hartman) sono stati strabilianti. Bella la colonna sonora, grandiosa la regia e anche la fotografia.

For starters, the setting brilliantly captures the tense atmosphere of Marine Corps training to prepare for war. This is best demonstrated when looking at the character Leonard Lawrence, better known as Private Pyle. Over the course of the first half of the film, Sargent Hartman, the brutal drill instructor, belittles him for being slow-witted and overall just not prepared for battle. To make matters worse he decides to punish the rest of the Marines for Pyle's mistakes. This is first seen when Pyle smuggles a doughnut because he could not deal with the feeling of hunger. Hartman retaliates by forcing the entire cabin to do intense exercises, causing them all to dislike Pyle. Tired of all of Pyle's screw ups, the entire bunk gives Pyle a beating. By each getting a towel, filling it with a bar of soap, and proceeding to hit him in the stomach repeatedly while others hold him down. After feeling immense pain and realizing that everyone hates him, Pyle loses all emotion and becomes a killing machine. Hartman and the others are very proud of him and all seems well until the next night. Private Joker, one of Pyle's fellow Marines, hears a noise in the restroom and decides to investigate only to find Pyle loading a rifle. Joker tells Pyle to go back to sleep and put his rifle away or else they will be in a world of shit. Pyle responds with, ""I'm already in a world of shit!"", and proceeds to repeat various chants that were spoken on their marches. After hearing all of the shouting Hartman storms in and proceeds to yell at Pyle and belittle him more. Void of all emotion and thought, Pyle shoots Hartman in the chest, killing him. Realizing what he had done, Pyle spends a few minutes reflecting, only before putting the rifle in his mouth and blowing his brains out. While all of this is very malicious and depressing, it is very realistic and corresponds to the tense environment of war to the point that it is almost beautiful. The training portion of the film is one of my favorite parts of any movie to this date earning this movie an easy five star rating. The section that illustrates war in Vietnam is also well made, but is honestly quite forgettable when looking at the first half of the film. Yet, this is still a movie that I would recommend to anyone, whether they typically enjoy films of this genre.",SHOW MORE,,

It was a little disorienting, in that there are essentially two different parts of the film. I got so invested in Pyle's story and watching that evolve, that I found myself having to readjust when the film segued into following Joker's story. Up until Pyle shot himself, I had assumed that this story was about Pyle. It was interesting to me that the perspective seemed to change in each part of the film. The first part seemed to be more from Pyle's perspective, to then set up the second part of the film being from Joker's perspective. It made me feel intrigued by the psyche of the men in the military. It made me also feel concerned for how the constant negating and invalidating affects these men. The pace of the film was also interesting. Things sort of seemed to have a slow build in the beginning up until Pyle's emotional turn took place. For me, the same thing happened in the second part of the film when Joker and his crew were backed into a corner with the Vietnamese. In both parts of the film, it was interesting that there was this slower-paced nonchalant approach to setting up these stories, however, once things got going we very much-so ""zoomed in"" to the conflict in the story and what was going on. Music was a big part of the movie, however, in these moments Kubrick chose to have no, or very little, music be a part of them. For me, it allowed me to be more attentive to what was going on and what was at stake.",SHOW MORE,,

Stanley Kubrick's smart adaptation and perfect execution works on its level and won't disappoint the fans but fails to deliver anything beyond that as the mere far fetched idea fades off slowly before one's eyes where even lousy editing too, becomes responsible. Matthew Modine at the centre of it pulls it off swiftly and smoothly but is overpowered by a stunning performance by Vincent D'Onofrio despite of just being a supportive character. Full Metal Jacket resonates too much with The Clockwork Orange as it raises similar questions, offers enough doubts and thrills which becomes redundant at a certain point and as always lacks better editing.",SHOW MORE,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/2dOFWPIZoSnds9VFe0igNs1LuxN,,,"Sep 14, 2017","Maybe not as good as it's been talked up to be, but still a solid war film. Based on Gustav Hasford's novel The Short Timers, the film's first half details the volunteers' harrowing boot-camp training under the profane, power-saw guidance of drill instructor Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a real-life drill instructor whose performance is one of the most terrifyingly realistic on record). Part two takes place in Nam, as seen through the eyes of the now thoroughly indoctrinated marines. Ironically, Full Metal Jacket was filmed almost entirely in England. ""Full Metal Jacket"" was one of the movies that was talked about when I praised films such as ""Hacksaw Ridge"". Apparently, this was the war film to behold, as it was just as good, if not better. I recently got the opportunity to view this movie and by that, it means I was in the mood for it and I saw it on Netflix. I really don't think this film is as good as its reputation suggests it is, but it's still solid. It's certainly the best film ever made, but it's certainly not bad. I guess it's just dated if anything. I'm not sure if this is a complaint or not, but this really did feel like two different films. The first hour of this film took place at boot camp. It felt repetitive, it dragged a bit, and even though it ended shockingly, it still wasn't enough for an A+ film. Then, when the second half came on, it became an entirely different film. In fact, all the weight the first half had became meaningless. So essentially, this was two different movies. I guess that really is a problem in the end, because by that point, why care about anything that happened in either half? The acting wasn't that great. The only real solid performance from here was Matthew Modine's performance. I actually thought he did a really good job. I thought his performance stood out amongst the rest, especially when other ones stood out negatively. A lot of the performances in this movie were less than adequate. They were either cheesy, cringe worthy, laughable, or just downright awkward. I don't think the best cast was chosen for this film, regardless of what the persona of their character was supposed to be. Although it's not the most visually grossing or hard hitting war film, it boasts these concepts and ideas that are pretty tough at times. The overall language and what was acceptable to say back then is completely different than it is today. I liked seeing that difference in past cultures and how we acted compared to how we do today. It also showed some things that did show that war is ugly. It's not pretty, it has its moments, and I think this film showed those aspects well. In the end, this isn't the best movie by any means. It's good, it has its fair share of problems. Maybe it's a bit dated, but maybe it was really good for its release year. In the end, I'm fairly neutral with it.",SHOW MORE,,

A smart move from the legend that was Stanley Kubrick. We've all seen many war films, a genre that is well explored from a variety of different conflicts. Full Metal Jacket however chooses to go behind the scenes and focus on the training process that changes well intentioned men into trained lethal killers. You could easily split this in half and have two separate films, the first half being more psychologically charged whereas the latter showcasing the brutality of warfare. A ridiculously serious drill sergeant practically bullying a trainee marine so harshly that it slowly turns him into an unstable psychopath. That right there, was some really good psychology and made the film so much more interesting. Sure the Vietnam War scenes were depicted with a substantial amount of fire, blood and guns but it was the first half that really captivated me. Vincent D'Onofrio was the stand out for me, both convincing and expressive through his face. Matthew Modine was good, probably his best performance. Lee Ermey deserves recognition just for somehow managing to not lose his voice from all the shouting. Characterisation was present, perhaps not fully fleshed out as I would like but was just enough for me to care about them. Yet again though, it's the technical marvel that wins...Stanley Kubrick. His directing style is so damn flawless. The nice clean long takes, actors looking directly into the camera, slow motion deaths (particularly in the sniper shootout)...he is just phenomenal. Script was sharp as well. A great section of dialogue where our lead character wears a peace badge and a helmet that says ""born to kill"" for which he describes represents the duality of man. That really stuck with me. So whilst it might feel like two separate films (due to that ridiculously quick transition), it's hard not to appreciate everything that's shown to us. Another hit from Mr. Kubrick.",SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,SUPER REVIEWER

It was released to positive reviews but I can see some chinks in the film. It focuses on raw recruits to the US Marines at the time of the Vietnam War. The psychological horrors it brought to some of these recruits is focused on. The film is split into two main acts. The first half of the film focuses on the training of a platoon of marines on Parris Island, in the U.S. One of the recruits Private Lenny Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) struggles with army life and the loud rule of the Sergeant (Lee Ermey). For about an hour of the film we see the portly Lawrence be for want of a better word be bullied by his commanding officer and fellow recruits before he snaps. The warning signs are all there. The raised eye facial expressions that are a trademark of Kubrick films (A Clockwork Orange and The Shining spring to mind.) The recruits become competent users of killer weapons and are warned by the Sergeant himself in one scene how ruthless killers like Lee Harvey Oswald were trained to shoot by the US Marines. The second half of the film is set in Vietnam itself in a variety of locations. Here the film became confusing as it drifted from one set piece to another. However the overriding theme that 'normal' civilians become killers for want of a better word or witness killing is the main theme. A film that shows the real horrors of conventional wzrfare to recruits to the army 'conscripted'.",SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,

But instead of preaching the beliefs of the filmmakers throughout, events are simply shown and the audience is responsible for deciding how they feel about it all. I don't even know how I'd go about recommending this movie, because while I really like it, there's such a wide range of tones and atmospheres that I wouldn't know how to describe it as just one package.

It is pure genius as we get a feel for life in boot camp, and the damaging effects these difficult training techniques can have on recruits. While the quality of the film-making continued once Joker left boot camp, the story dropped off a little. There were still flashes of greatness, but it didn't gel into a complete story as well as I expected. However, the themes were effectively conveyed. You really get a feel for how damaging war can be on the men who must fight it, and what the military is compelled to do in order to keep those men fighting (even in a lost cause.) The final confrontation of the film is devastating and I love how it wraps things up and pays off on things foreshadowed up to that point. In fact, the more I reflect on the movie, the more I recognize its brilliance. I wonder if, upon further viewings, I might find that this is truly a 5-star classic. The only thing that makes me skeptical about the quality of Full Metal Jacket is Matthew Modine. I don't think he's the best actor for this role, and he doesn't really ""become"" the character. Everyone else seems perfectly fit to the film (particularly Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Hartman) but he stands out as an actor delivering an uncomfortable performance that doesn't work as well as I would like. Despite that if you haven't seen Full Metal Jacket, and you have the stomach for war movies that feel gritty and realistic, then make watching it a priority.",SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,

It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's lacks his signature style once you get past the boot camp segment. I think this is why a lot people say that the boot camp portion is better than the larger portion of the movie that actually takes place in Vietnam. Spoilers: It's not. There is a difference between being anti-military and anti-war, neither opinions are clearly right or wrong and that (among some other themes, masculinity being the other most obvious one) is what this movie is about. In boot camp we all want to be Joker. He's the intellectual, sarcastic one who understands ""the duality of man"" after all. But when you get on the ground Animal Mother starts to make a whole lot more sense. Overall I think it could have been a bit better if it had sunk into a more definitive style and the voice over could have been removed without losing almost anything of importance.

Full Metal Jacket does not have American propaganda such as Saving Private Ryan. It is much more personal. It is more of a study of the soul of its protagonists similar to All Quiet On The Western Front (1930). This should be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It reminds me how great a film-maker Kubrick was. He made few films, but each was arguably a masterpiece.

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/GPgF0zCKwFeAs8ZHwDiMKsKmue8,,,"Dec 23, 2015","With a simple message and a simple structure, perhaps Full Metal Jacket wants to convey the experience of war as viscerally as possible. But it's hard to call this a war film, as there's no one to root for, or sympathize with, or identify with. This is certainly a Kubrick film: masterfully crafted and interesting with naturalistic performances and provocative images. But it's also something less: in its negativity and cynicism and dehuminization, it's more of a nihilist jaunt through violence and depravity than an artistic statement. There's no real tragedy, only the fate of poor Gomer Pyle, probably the unique spirit that can't survive in the army. Instead of hinting at his themes, Kubrick has his ""Joker"" shout them at you, informing his conversant that the peace symbol and ""born to kill"" on his helmet represents ""the duality of man"". Perhaps Full Metal Jacket is about nothing more than how humans can kill and be killed. Or perhaps it's a meandering and ultimately toothless attempt to satirize war by having monstrous men do monstrous things on camera. But what we'll never know is why Kubrick slowed down so suddenly, how the man who once wished to film Napoleon with 50,000 real soldiers settled for R Lee Ermey slinging violent language at young men. How can the same man who made 2001 make Full Metal Jacket after Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter already existed? What happened to the compelling and heroic humanity of Paths of Glory, or unstoppable craftsman of The Shining? It's safe to say we'll never know. But as for Full Metal Jacket, there's blood, there's yelling and there's death. There's men who are mere cartoons of men, foreigners who amount to nothing more than whores and cowardly snipers. Lacking the dynamism and sheer brilliance and beauty of every Kubrick film from Paths of Glory to The Shining, Full Metal Jacket just doesn't measure up. You'll laugh at first, until you realize that a man is being tortured on screen, and then you'll hate the rest of them, and you might just wish that they all die, or better, that they all get killed, which is apparently all that humans can do according to this movie.",SHOW MORE,,

That was not the case for me watching Full Metal Jacket. I found that it was the complete opposite actually. This movie is somewhat split into two totally different parts. Kubrick depicts a group of Marines during their experience in boot camp, with a downright brutal drill sergeant. You follow these guys through all of their training and day to day routines getting ready to get their assignment and get shipped off to Vietnam to fight for the country. This is actually the part of the movie I enjoyed the most. When they actually get to the war I felt the movie starts to drag a little bit. Maybe it was just that the boot camp was so intense and the story of Private Pile so engrossing and somewhat disturbing towards the end that I just thought the movie could have honestly ended there.

There's a number of reasons for why, but I think the main one is that the first half has this propulsive quality to it that the second half just lacks. Every scene in the first half just zips by because of the drill instructor Sgt. Hartman, who just never lets up, screaming constantly so it's impossible to look away even for a second (this is especially because R. Lee Ermey is so magnetic in the role). The pacing of the first half feels flawless; the audience still needs to feel small moments of reprieve out of necessity, and so those are provided for in the scenes between Pyle and Joker. You really feel for Pyle in those scenes, and get this sense that he's a gentle giant, this poor ignorant guy who just needs someone to be there for him when he's relentlessly tortured by Hartman. Joker provides that kind relief that Pyle (and the audience) needs in between exhausting scenes with Hartman. And then that all ends when Pyle is assaulted by his fellow Marine volunteers, and Joker reluctantly takes part. It's pretty tragic because Joker doesn't realize at the time that if he had stood up for Pyle, if he'd stuck by him in his hardest moments, maybe what inevitably happens wouldn't have happened. And yeah, we haven't even talked about that final scene, in which Pyle kills Hartman and then himself. Just crazy, man. I sort of saw it coming that he would go crazy, but I somehow thought the movie wouldn't go there, and it did. The second half has a lot of standout images and dialogue that make it far from pointless. Adam Baldwin's character, Animal Mother, is an interesting guy because it's pretty damn heartless until the end, when he vows to get revenge on the sniper who killed his friends, and then in the last scene, when he's disgusted by the thought of killing a little girl. There are some funny lines, like Joker's talk about the peace sign and the 'born to kill' writing representing the 'duality of man,' and there are some interesting, thematically strong interludes, like when one soldier reveals that the guy sitting next to him under a blanket is a dead Vietnamese soldier, brought back as some sort of sick prize. All of these moments of originality and thematic potency are especially powerful because of Stanley Kubrick's direction. He shoves you into all of these scenes and forces you to confront them; when Rafterman records the man with the pet Vietcong carcass on camera, we see it from the camera's point of view, so it's like the twisted soldier is telling us directly. There are a lot of moments like that in the movie, when people seem to be staring right at us, especially at the end, when the wounded sniper girl looks up at us and begs us to shoot her. And then there's the whole recurring idea of the 'thousand yard stare,' and Joker's final action in killing the young girl and achieving that stare. His choice to kill her, while merciful in a way, is dark because we've seen him resisting darkness the whole movie, and we've hoped that maybe he could make up for his role in Pyle's bullying. But finally he kills the girl, and it's ostensibly merciful, but it sure looks like execution to us. So there are a lot of images in the second half that are great and carry a lot of emotional and satirical heft, even if that meaning is as reductive as ""war sucks,"" something that tons of movies, like Apocalypse Now, have already done. And the shapelessness that makes me not like the second half as much has been said to have a point. War, after all, is shapeless and confusing and chaotic and messy. Still, just because a movie's unpleasant (exaggerating for effect here) structure and pacing are that way for the express purpose of making a point doesn't mean they're enjoyable on a shallow level, and I like my movies to be at least somewhat entertaining on a shallow level. There's a ruthless efficiency to the first half that's inevitably missed in the second level, even if the formal elements continue to support the tone of the respective sections. Overall, this was a movie I really enjoyed, with a kickass, tragic first half with a unique setting in a boot camp, and a second half that was a little less enjoyable because of its slow-paced shapelessness and the absence of Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. Still, there were enough vivid images and nice dialogue throughout the second half that it made up for most of its shortcomings and delivered an adequate second half to an ambitious, dark story.",SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,

So what could Kubrick offer? The answer: The polarizing ""two films in one"" movie ""Full Metal Jacket"". We follow the training and service of some young men who are eager to ""fight the good fight"" in Vietnam. Out of all the short list of Stanley Kubrick films, this is the film that I consider the most peculiar and experimental as I find the choices Kubrick made bizarre but extremely fascinating. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is this intriguing version of the Vietnam War that has solid acting with the best being R. Lee Ermey in an iconic role and Vincent D´Onofrio; the dialog is extremely sharp edge and vulgar but surprisingly is hilarious at times and mostly memorable, Kubrick´s most distinctive use of music as they are widely popular songs or highly irrelevant to the war setting, an uneven pacing that at times takes you out of the experience but at others it flawlessly works as it literally throws you into the scene, the cinematography is as gorgeous as most Kubrick films, a distant and omnipresent storytelling that creates this cynical style, the themes are executed extremely effectively, some of the visuals are haunting and realistic, and Kubrick provides his most experimental directing as most of the time it is fast and feels like the whole film is a montage. The biggest criticisms the film are that the first half is incredible but the second is dull and forgettable, of course the most iconic and memorable section is the first half and while the second half never reaches that level of quality it also has some memorable moments, particularly the climax of the film. The other criticism is the overall feel of the film (some Vietnam vets consider it extremely accurate but others consider it a fantasy take of the war) because it is not like other Vietnam films where they are set in a jungle and have more moral dilemmas; it is an odd way to present war but I believe that the film is not about Vietnam but about war in generally due to its dehumanization themes (actually the visuals are more reminiscent of urban warfare and the War on Terror, which is scary considering this is a film from the 80´s). ""Full Metal Jacket"" is an experimental take of the Vietnam War that feels like two great movies smashed together via montage. While it is by no means one of the Kubrick´s greatest, it is not one of the weakest. It is funny, haunting, heavy on themes, and the most interesting Kubrick film (directing wise).",SHOW MORE,,

His filming ingenuity only got better as time went on, and Full Metal Jacket is proof of this fact. In this movie, Kubrick relied heavily on a soundtrack to tell the narrative through the technique of satire. I believe that this soundtrack is used to establish an ironical relationship between the audience and the characters in the movie. In other words, Kubrick uses the soundtrack as an ironic plot device. For example, the choice to use ""The Chapel of Love"" while the men are at war serves to either make fun of or emphasize the desperate attitudes of some of the soldiers experiencing post-traumatic stress. In other words, the movie indirectly makes fun of steadfast patriotism when war instead really promises mental insanity.",SHOW MORE,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/AlBF6GTGeikgTpzI6gfYXiKjsaQ,,,"Dec 22, 2014","Review In A Nutshell: When we think of war, the images that come to our head are the smoke that slowly breathes out of a fired rifle, the red blood that stains the green uniform, the flash of an exploding grenade; these are dark images that fill the puzzle of war's brutality and horror, but what these images do not show is the horrors that lurk underneath; the human spirit fractured in order to fulfil their duty as soldiers. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket stands along with films like Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line, and Paths of Glory where war is seen through the eyes of the soldiers and how their experiences have affected them internally; the unseen soul. The film begins with the sight of men sitting down and having their hair shaved completely off with faces of both sadness and uncertainty. It is the U.S. Marine's first step in attempting to take what is most precious of them, their identities. It is the idea that each and every one of these soldiers will be identical fighting machines, despite the drill instructor denying this, to strip them completely of what they were and instil a new perspective on yourself, your brothers, and your enemies. The film then takes us to the intimidating introduction of their drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman, a man who response only to sheer volume and intensity, constantly searching for flaws and anomalies in the soldiers' systems and destroying them little by little. This is also where we get to see these soldiers further lose themselves, through the replacement of their names with nicknames that are far from who they really are, aside from maybe Joker, whom which probably impressed the Sergeant despite his disrespect. During this introduction is also the time where the audience is formally introduced to Leonard Lawrence, who is better known in the camp as Gomer Pyle, as a connection to his inherent dimwittedness and innocence; he becomes the Sergeant immediate target because he knows Gomes Pyle is not right for the corps but since he is already present and unlikely to quit, he has to do the best he can to push him to his highest limits. Gomer Pyle's journey through the training is one of the most terrifying experiences I have ever seen, showing how a fresh young face could fall so low in human spirit; a soul that has suffered psychological and emotional torment, betrayal from his once loyal and respected brothers, having to endure demanding and straining physical training, it all adds up in shaping what he would ultimately become, a soulless monster. The end of this half delivered one of the most gasping moments of the entire film, the bathroom massacre. A slow moving Joker flashes his light on Gomer Pyle, revealing him in possession of a live cartridge that is then locked and loaded into his rifle. It is clear that the training he has endured has pushed him too far, deprived of happiness and consciousness, knowing only his duty as a marine corps, to kill. It is the horrifying image of his wicked stare that shivers the audience's bones, not the loaded rifle itself; it is the idea that he has gone too far to find salvation, and it was only in the sound of his once precious name that a glimmer came to his eye and decides to end himself once and for all, sparing Joker's life. It is a moment that stays with you long after the film ends, reminding you of the many Gopher Pyles out there walking and causing pain to those undeserving of it. The second half of the film then turns to the big stage, Vietnam and the war that deeply affected everyone that took part in it. It still follows in the eyes of Joker who works as a correspondent for an American newspaper, Stars and Stripes, which aimed to report news, boost soldier morale, and sway the minds of those unconvinced of America's involvement in the war; it is an element that Kubrick only covers minimally, but hearing it spoke volumes to me; displaying more of what the war really is, without having to actually show it. It would have been fantastic if Kubrick further covered it. After a suicide squad attempting to infiltrate their base, Joker was assigned to the ""shit"" with his photographer Rafterman, and from there we experience the true nature of soldier warfare; the unpredictability, the paranoia, the destruction that surrounds them, all coming to together to slowly destroy the innocent mind of our protagonist; a person who had a sense of balance, surviving the war with killing in his head, ""Born to Kill"", and forgiveness in his heart, the peace symbol, retaining that part of himself that keeps him sane. The film subtly throughout this half, question the true agenda of the soldier's stay in Vietnam, told from the perspective of the soldiers themselves through documentary-like interviews that show honest and thoughtful responses. The film then leads to a gripping climax of a sniper picking off their platoon, one by one. It is a tense situation that ends with harrowing imagery. It is revealed that the sniper is just a young girl, and through this Kubrick scares us with the idea that children were raised and trained in order to fight for their causes, youth losing its innocence far too early, wanting her life to end rather than ask for medical attention; it is a frightening scene that shows just how damaged our world is. Ending the film, is a slightly touching scene of soldiers marching in the night, singing out loud a song from their beloved childhood; holding tight a piece of themselves in order to get through god-awful war. Full Metal Jacket may not be the most obvious film in regards to Kubrick's sense of visual and audible flair, but the film's grounded visual take on the war is meaningful and terrifying. During the film's first half, it captures the uniform and tightness of military training, a zone where anarchy and natural movements are absent. During interior scenes, we get a layer of darkness that connects with the gradual loss of the souls of its subjects, coming off more like a mental asylum rather than a barrack; very few films could capture this without becoming too stylish in its imagery. The second half of the film opens up with a larger canvas, displaying the destructive conditions of the war; with sights of crumbling buildings, flaming interiors, and abundance of dirt. The film still manages to be a spectacle without forgetting the film's most important subjects, the characters. The second half spends a fair amount of time with the camera closer to the ground, along the feet of the soldiers, like as if we were trying to take cover from enemy fire, a paranoia of having our heads stand too high; it maintains a sense of uneasiness that correlates with the emotions of its characters. Kubrick almost strips the whole film with vibrant colours, keeping the film feeling deathly and soul crushing; pushing dark greens and dusty browns, the colours that immediately bring to mind the conditions of war. The haunting score by Vivian Kubrick, under the alias of Abigail Mead, dominates the film's scenes through generating dark and atmospheric emotions that elevate the film's themes and tension; just listen to the rumbling seedy tones during the bathroom massacre. The same goes for the sniper sequence, with music that crawls under our skin and feeds dark and fracturing emotions. The combination of Kubrick's score and Americana soundtrack gave the film that sense of balance and flavour, coming off as different from the other films that cover the same ground; it never tries to over-dramatize its scenes, instead the score reaches for the darker depths of the film's characters without drama elevation, while the soundtracks are present to create a hilarious satire of America's presence in the war. Matthew Modine is the film's protagonist, Private Joker, but I felt his performance was a bit underwhelming as compared to others that have led in a Kubrick film; the writing certainly makes his role feel interesting but his performance rarely ever elevates it. The shining star in this film is an actor who only appears during the first half of the film, and that is Vincent D'Onofrio playing as Gomer Pyle; a transformational performance that captures the essence of his character perfectly. Full Metal Jacket is an example of a war film attempting to be more than what it plainly is; it showcases the inherent nature of war and its effects on the human mind and soul. It tells a story that is not restricted by a conventional three act approach, and it features a stand out performance from D'Onofrio as the lovable turned deadly, Gomer Pyle. I think I'm going to love this film for a long time.",SHOW MORE,,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/qA0FOgHpXIlvuRgHzOf9GHkzTzy,,,"Oct 23, 2014","Director Stanley Kubrick done some nice explorations in his projects. He'd explored space with systematic corruption and boredom, and the insane, hysteric horror of a human mind and condition. Both of those are his 3.5-star masterpieces. His best work belongs to the battlefield of the war genre. In that field he'd explored the consequences of stopping yourself from following commands and get framed and shot for cowering, and the satiric reason why we need to learn to ""stop worrying and love the bomb."" Now before his final project of ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" he returned to the battlefield one more time to add another the story to the chronicles of the Vietnam War, and it'd resulted to be his best masterpiece. ""Full Metal Jacket"" explores the process of a new recruit entering from boot camp to the battlefields in the U.S. Marine Corps. The first 20 minutes were the recruits' training period. It was a masterful exposition with the cast only saying things that are around under the category of ""Sir, yes sir!"" to R. Lee Ermey's not-so fictional character when he was a drill instructor at that time the film takes place. He stands out and shines the most out of the cast when his performance is so good that it's probably the best of the film. He was also expressing a theme with a message to be analyzed and he had Vincent D'Onofrio as his volunteer to help out that message to the unfortunate outcome: D'Onofrio's character was mirroring a bit of how Jack Nicholson's character gone through in ""The Shining,"" but by the subject of the expressed theme of hypocrite bullying. Now for the main story that'd took the next 93 minutes was the main setting: fighting in the war on tour. Matthew Modine's character James Davis is the story's narrator going over how haunting and violent the Vietnam War can from what he'd experienced from commander of the recruits with a thirst to see combat to ""later becomes an independent-minded combat correspondent."" We'll be soon get in combat side-by-side with his old comrades from Sergeant Hartman's (R. Lee Ermey) boot camp, when he's nicknamed the Joker - representing some of the film's occasional light-hearted humor. The way how Davis's experiences in the war were constructed in the film was nicely done as usual in the war genre. The effects of combat, including the power and energy from the actors pretending/acting like they're in the war, and the performances are what a war flick reload to keep the power going.

The hoo-rah Marine Corps mystique comes under fire in particular, with a stunning analysis of the mental and emotional breakdown of recruits at Paris Island, with some harrowing twists and turns (fired by a remarkable depiction of drill sergeants). The Vietnam act suffers from Kubrick's obvious struggle in effectively filming combat zones and firefights, but his narrative is constructed so well in its bleakness and despair that it doesn't matter too much. Juxtaposition of period rock music is unsettling as well.

The movie is very difficult to watch, so entertaining it is not. But important? I'd say so. Though moments tend to drag here and there, Kubrick contributes his signature vision to the film that exists in all of his work and differentiates him as one of the greats. The acting is fine here as well, most notably that of R. Lee Ermey as the drill sergeant from Hell and Vincent D'Onofrio as the Marine trainee who undergoes a seriously frightening mental breakdown (the bathroom scene is impossible to forget).",SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/wLrF6nTmeSxAhLeHMRhvwSoVFVX,,,"Aug 1, 2014","Kubrick always had a cold detachment. Whether it be focusing on the exploitation of soldiers from their peers in ""Paths of Glory"" or laughing to the nuclear gallows with ""Dr. Strangelove,"" it was obvious that Kubrick preferred cynicism over warmth. 'Full Metal Jacket' most certainly follows Kubrick's cynical perception, a movie that reflects the Marine Corps deconstruction of the human being to become a natural born killer. Thematically, Kubrick's anti-war message is one that has been told time and time again. However, and with the help of the hilarious Sergeant Hartman (Ermey) - a character that continually shouts disgusting simile's and metaphors that creates an enjoyable balance of dark humour - Kubrick's deliverance of this recycled message is undeniably riveting. Besides Ermey's performance, Kubrick's ability as craftsman most certainly elevates the somewhat tiresome material. Not only is the direction spot on but also the meticulous touches to the lighting and music that contribute to overall harrowing affect (especially during the sequence where Pyle commits suicide; the lighting, the direction and music all combine perfectly to reflect the descent into violent madness). However, while these themes are portrayed with power, there are times where you feel Kubrick is being too cynical or simply too simplistic. Surely all Marine Corps are not systematic to point that there is no room for some gesture of humour or characterization? I know Kubrick is representing the deconstruction of humane qualities contributed from war, but such a focus makes the story at times rather dull (this is quite noticeable in the second half with the spark of the Ermey missing and the audience are left with a group of uninteresting cold-blooded killing machines). Besides these shortcomings in the second half, Kubrick's direction of Nam's battlefields are once again riveting. Revisiting the tracking shots he adopted in 'Paths of Glory,' Kubrick places the camera in a position so the audience are invited into the films battle depictions against the backdrop of the beautiful destructive scenery. Rather than giving the audience the benefit of an omnipresent vision, Kubrick situates the audience in the soldiers position which creates a realistic feel that many war films seem to lack. Fundamentally, while Kubrick's vision at times is too cynical, ""Full Metal Jacket"" features a great amount of enjoyable black humour and a craftsman at the top of his game.",SHOW MORE,,

What all these movies have in common is that, although they show a broad perspective of war, they have memorable characters who really bring emotions to this movie. But even setting these aside, Full Metal Jacket never really starts from a war perspective. It starts with the scrutinizing life under a drill sergeant(incredible performance by R. Lee Ermey) and slowly eases into the war scene. However even during war, the scenes slowly eases into the heart of the war. The cinematography is beautiful and if you notice, most of the shots have been taken during the golden hour where the best lighting for films are possible. This style really contrasts with the themes in the film which really brings up new emotions under this genre. Its something which only someone like Kubrick could bring about.

It simply shows you what a normal (and bloody) day these men went through during the Vietnam war. This is what makes it enjoyable. With nothing to try and work out, you can simply sit back and enjoy it. What also adds to the experience is the recreation of the Vietnam war zone.

The film is based on the novel 'The Short Timers' by Gustaph Hasford and portraits the training and actual combat action of some young marines during the Vietnam War. Kubrick is a master in storytelling by showing hard facts mixed with well-chosen music. A couple of scenes will be glued to your memory. This 'Full Metal Jacket' is a must-see classic. Starring Matthew Modine (The Transporter 2, Weeds), Adam Baldwin (Predator 2, Independence Day), Vincint D'Onofrio (Men in Black, The Cell) and R. Lee Ermey (The Texas Chainsaw remakes, Willard). 1967, Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (Ermey) trains a load of U.S. Marine Corps recruits in their boot camp. His iron fist will discipline the boys. One of them is James Davis (Modine), who is given the nickname 'Joker'. He dares to take a stand and considered to be in charge of his fellow recruits. Another is the clumsy overweight Leonard Lawrence (D'Onofrio) who earns the nickname 'Gomer Pyle'. He suffers the most from Hartman's boot camp training. With some help from 'Joker', he does seem to improve. But when Hartman discovers that 'Gomer Pyle' has stashed away a jelly doughnut: the whole squad is punished for his deeds... The following year, 'Joker' has become a war correspondent at the Vietnam War. When the Tet Offensive kicks in, he joins a platoon of Marines on a deadly mission. There he sees one of his of boot camp mates and meets machine gunner 'Animal Mother' (Baldwin). Will they live to tell the tale?",SHOW MORE,,

The film takes place during the Vietnam War, with the first half focusing on basic training and the second half on the soldier's experiences in Vietnam. The first half is really where the film shines, having a clear message with so very humorous insults from R. Lee Ermey (who was a real-life drill instructor). When the film switches over to Vietnam, however, the film gradually goes downhill. There are a bunch of little short segments, most of them not being important to the story at all, but there are so truly great moments, especially the helicopter scene. Also, alll of the battle scenes are extremely well done, especially the final battle between the soldiers and the sniper. Full Metal Jacket isn't a perfect film, especially with it's disappointing second half, but it's truly great scenes mostly make up for this.",SHOW MORE,,

It also has gritty moments and impressive performances that are very impressive. There are slow parts in the middle that seem to drag on but it somewhat adds to the realism of the film. The finale of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and the film's psychological ideas are bound to spark lots of discussion.,SHOW MORE,https://images.fandango.com/cms/assets/5d84d010-59b1-11ea-b175-791e911be53d--rt-poster-defaultgif.gif,

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/profiles/WYdF8vHDzhGJf9XFWdF89SRyfG0,,,"Mar 16, 2014","Second half isn't that interesting, but this is undoubtedly a Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. Based off The Short-Timers, a semi-autobiographical book by Gustav Hasford, Full Metal Jacket follows a US Marine platoon going through training, later transitioning its focus to two Marines of the platoon in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. The film does tons of detail exploring the steps that are taken into becoming a Marine, including following orders correctly, moving through obstacles quickly and flawlessly, remaining organized, preparing weapons correctly, and remaining close to the squad the soldier is assigned to. The film, like many masterful war films, uses tons of graphic violence and personal conflict in order to add realism and humanity to the story in order to prevent Full Metal Jacket from going into generic war film territory. Stanley Kubrick uses his unbelievable genius to craft a film that says ""war"". He does an incredible job by giving audiences heart breaking battle sequences that also shock them rather than entertain them (thank God, because war is disgraceful). Kubrick, Michael Herr, and author Hasford craft a script that expands Part I, and contains elements of Part II and III, yet omits Part III. Part II isn't that engaging or as interesting or psychologically disturbing as Part I, but is still a key element to the story, even if it's message isn't that great. The acting is stellar, most particularly R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a ruthless, mean, foul-mouthed drill instructor who actually was played by a US Marine drill instructor who was in service during the Vietnam War, and Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence, an overweight, clumsy, incompetent, slow-witted recruit who in fact becomes the focus for Sergeant Hartman for his flaws. In fact, R. Lee Ermey's scene where he chewed out the new recruits was mostly improvised, despite the fact that Kubrick never allowed his actors to improvise, although he allowed a few to do that, R. Lee Ermey's being one of them, which helped show off the brutality of his character, especially to D'Onofrio's Pyle. In fact, this scene should've gotten him an Oscar nod, same goes for D'Onofrio. Vincent is able to capture the recruit going from a troubled man, to an insane, creepy, and flawless recruit whose unpredictable in every corner. The change in D'Onofrio's character shows that people can change even before they go to war (nonviolence anyone?), and that training can have negative implications in them and/or their platoon. A must-see, especially for anyone who's against war.",SHOW MORE,,

The first part is almost a comedy of sorts until it takes a dark turn late and they get shipped out to war. The tone changes a bit and it feels more like a documentary of sorts where the soldiers don't really know why they are there, but do it anyways. They go on a mission where they find a sniper who pins them down so they must find a way to survive before they are all killed. A pretty interesting movie, felt the first half was a little more interesting and moved along better and the second half wandered around just a little too much before ending abruptly.

Full Metal Jacket proves this maneuver successful. Kubrick's ability to blend moods, specifically within the first 40 minutes, is at an all time high, presenting to us some hilarious yet intense drill instructing from the one and only R. Lee Ermey. On a deeper level, it illustrates the complete deterioration of the troops in the Marine corps to the point of losing their last remaining shreds of humanity, leaving them lifeless, killer husks. This is displayed by Kubrick in his signature intensity and terror that no other horror flick can bring to the script and screen.",SHOW MORE,,

It follows the Vietnam war theme of the time and compares favorably with the rest, but it isn't the best one. I haven't seen all the Vietnam movies of the time, I have yet to see Apocolips Now, but I think this will be one of the better ones. My favorite Vietnam movie is We Were Soldiers, second is Hamburger Hill, and although this movies good, it dosent come close to them in my opinion. The first half of the movie at boot camp was not as good as I expected, and kinda let me down although it was funny, but the second half made up for that. It shows how inhumane war turns soldiers, and is graphic and suspenseful. But the acting isn't great, some lines are poorly written and some things are overdone. Also I didn't like the scenes where they shoot at the buildings because of how the whole 4 story wall of the building would seem to explode in dust and exploding shells. And thats not the only thing that largely exaggerated. Not the best Vietnam war movie but pretty good, and it nice that it includes a rural battle setting, which is a good change from other Vietnam war films.",SHOW MORE,,

It's Stanley Kubrick's best movie as well. It's a great tale the follows the story of a few marines and shows the true horrors of war with a dark comedic tone. The acting is incredible and the war scenes are great and realistic. R. Lee Ermey was so believable in the role as a drill instructor...but that's because he use to be one and a lot of his lines are improvised. It's a truly haunting movie and once I tune in my focus never leaves the movie whenever I watch it. It's a truly compelling movie and I don't get why a lot of people say the second half ruins it, I think it adds a lot too it. The soundtrack too is great, especially during the war scenes, their not really what you'd expect to hear in a movie like this and it's just great. It's probably the most realistic Vietnam War movie of the 80's. It's a really great movie.",SHOW MORE,,
