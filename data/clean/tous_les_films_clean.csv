review,Titre
"About what I expected and there’s a reason I waited months before watching it. I’m not surprised at all the critics love it. Good acting and directing. But a little pretentious and self important. A pretty good story which is something the critical darlings don’t often have, so I can see why the audiences liked it. But long and slow. And a big shift in tone at the end. They wanted to wrap it up without just text so did a weird scene.",killerofthemoon
"Had its ""moments"" but those moments weren't enough for over 3 1/2 hours that runtime really dragged the film down. It did nothing for me",killerofthemoon
This is one of Scorsese's worst. This movie has no business being 3 hours long. The performances were also overrated. The entire thing is forgetable.,killerofthemoon
Definitely was a little slow. But overall it made me lookup this ugly event in history. Liked the movie would have been great to see on the big screen.,killerofthemoon
"Killers of the Flower Moon is currently the best film of the decade so far. One of Scorsese’s many masterpieces, the film shows true good and evil and the nuances between. The film has a powerhouse performance for Montana’s Lily Gladstone.",killerofthemoon
"Because of the run time I'm glad I saw it at home. I watched it in 2 parts. Having said that, i don't get why people who average up to 9 hours of daily screen time are complaining. Show some respect. The acting was great. The story is gut wrenching and it immerses you. If its history its history and a tale that deserves to be told. Many blessings to the Osage.",killerofthemoon
"Good actors and set pieces but the story was confusing and borderline boring. No real suspense throughout a movie that I guess was supposed to be a murder mystery as the whole “whodunnit?” Is played out almost immediately. Whole movie just comes across as flat, dull, and forgetful, if it weren’t for big name actors and directors, this film would’ve flopped harder.",killerofthemoon
"Awesome movie with great acting but it is soooo long and the pacing is kinda meh but otherwise its a fine movie, Lily Gladstone's performance was phenomenal and worth an Oscar nom and almost win",killerofthemoon
"Of course I read the book first, and the book was really great. And of course in the book you don't get to know who the real killers are until you're well into it. The movie clumsily blurts it out right away, and then you have to sit through three hours of boringness. Why would they do that? Does Scorsleazy get paid by the minute? I thought Decaprio did a good job with his character, but Deniro was awful, and I must say badly cast for this movie. Jesse Plemons is spot on, but they could have had fun with the Hoover character if they....well, if they had enough time. lol. Perhaps a different director could have shaped this film better.",killerofthemoon
It’s a good movie but once again I think the critics bow down to the subject matter and not the actual movie. Much of it was very slow and drawn out. It felt more like a crime series than a movie. All the actors were brilliant but the praise it received felt more like sympathy for the character rather than praise for the story. To me is was overrated as far as entertainment goes and especially for Martin Scorsese. I always rate movies on the likelihood of wanting to watch it again and again. I just don’t feel like any movie that I wouldn’t watch again isn’t a great movie.,killerofthemoon
"An impressive and beautiful movie, but not very enjoyable due to the heavy subject matter. Lily Gladstone gives a devastating performance, full of stoic endurance, vulnerablity and inner fortitude.",killerofthemoon
"From director to cast, perfect as usual. Brutal and beautiful at the same time. You will not be disappointed. Great performances in a great story that needed to be tell.",killerofthemoon
"A great movie that spoke on some dark stuff. But at the end of the day, the extra hour did not tell anymore than the other 2 did. Its just a bloated film for indie/drama/long film critics",killerofthemoon
"It was super dry and it took me a few sittings to finish it since it I was so long, but the story kept me entertained till the end. Great cast and directing as expected.",killerofthemoon
Definitely a flawed but great film about the Native Americans. I may not be Native American myself but I’m still glad this movie exists and I’m glad I watched it.,killerofthemoon
"Tough to watch Robert De Niro in new projects, he is one of America’s greatest actors and yet has been destroyed by Trump derangement. Vital for Actors to have a level of mystery. The less we know the better, more believable characters.",killerofthemoon
"The movie's plot was really sad. What white boys did to the Indians, but there was literally no need for the runtime to be 3 hours and 28 minutes, I mean what the hell??? That is why 2 stars and I am being generous...",killerofthemoon
"This is the effort of an outdated director. This style doesn't play anymore, and doing stories where Native Americans are so poorly treated border on trauma porn. A shame!",killerofthemoon
"If you are really psyched to see what you know to be a really good movie, then note and admire the actors performances, cinematography and music yet STILL fall asleep three times during the movie...is it REALLY a good movie?",killerofthemoon
"Disappointing film compared to Martin Scorsese's other films. Tries to do too many things at once, and unsure of what is being done with Leonardo's character, it's almost like they couldn't decide what he should be, may have been better to put more focus on Lily's character or perspective, or even Robert De Niro's character's POV, but no, most of the film seemed indecisive.",killerofthemoon
"From a film standpoint this is great. The acting and music in this are great and the story intriguing. Man though, this is long. We didn't finish it in one night but split it into two which I recommend if it starts getting late because there might not be anything preventing you from falling asleep. I can't pin point what about the ending I don't like. Maybe it's the fact that it sort of feels abrupt or that there's not really any redemption in it. Still a good watch and Martin Scorsese still shows off at his craft in this film. I certainly liked the story.",killerofthemoon
"A good movie that touches on some unique themes in a meaningful way, but feels so incredibly slow and dragged out that a lot of the tension just dissipates before the plot is resolved.",killerofthemoon
"All the cast members really did great, which is an understatement. This is the first I see of Lily Gladstone, and she's just superb. Leonardo di Caprio, my favorite in this movie, is at the top of his game as well, and Robert de Niro is unsurprisingly amazing too. Despite a three-hour run, the story feels well-paced and doesn't really drag much. The story is also really distressing in some parts as well and this might be his most brutal film yet. I really cannot forget it, some of those scenes are still stuck in my mind and still makes me feel a bit emotional. I also love the minimal use of score, makes things feel more...I dunno...raw? I also love the ending, very creative. I highly recommend for you to watch this.",killerofthemoon
"Awesome movie, with very interesting story that needed to be told, also great acting but it is indeed very slow paced and way too long. not for the tik tok generation for sure.",killerofthemoon
"If you can sustain the indignation from the abusive and horrible traetment of white people towards the Osage people, it is definiotively worth the view",killerofthemoon
"É fantástico como você fica envolvido em toda conspiração em relação a trama do filme, ele te surpreende e não ser massante mesmo com a longa duração",killerofthemoon
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is an ambitious and visually stunning film that showcases Martin Scorsese's masterful direction and strong performances, particularly from Lily Gladstone. The movie thoughtfully explores a dark chapter of American history, shedding light on the injustices faced by the Osage people. However, despite its importance and meticulous craftsmanship, the storytelling feels overly drawn out, making it difficult to stay fully engaged. The extended runtime, while intended to add depth, ultimately slows the pacing, making the experience more exhausting than immersive.",killerofthemoon
A masterfully crafted film that shines a spotlight on one of the darkest chapters in American history. Martin Scorsese delivers an intense and poignant narrative. 10/10.,killerofthemoon
"Good performances and great production, despite some major core issues. The first 15-20min of the film is awesome. An opening montage of tribal life, a history of oil discovery, an explanation of oil headrights, and the beginning of crime and murder for the money all make for a start that pulls you in. The production design was so accurate, giving the sense that the cameraman had time-traveled right back to those days and filmed real-life events. Scorsese lures you in, and you find yourself trapped, unable to look away as the horrors unfold... and keep unfolding... until you find yourself just as exhausted as Lily Gladstone looks in her final scene. CONTINUE READING ON LETTERBOXD: ",killerofthemoon
"Such a great story, such a great setup, was very intrigued the first third of the way through maybe even close to half, but it became very boring... A lot happened but nothing happened if that makes sense. So glad I didn't watch in theater.",killerofthemoon
"A very well made and acted film that captures the essence of a sad and tragic true story. I think it could have been drastically edited and it could have provided a better ending. My biggest quip is the closing scene. While a creative way to end the movie, it didn’t do the rest of the movie justice. A written epilogue and then the very last drumming scene would have been a better closer. At any rate, a must see.",killerofthemoon
"A beautiful sad, meaningful epic. The cinematography, scenery, acting and topic is stellar. I do think it could have cut 20-30 mins out with less artistic b-roll shots - but it wasn't a drag by any means.",killerofthemoon
"with Leo and DeNiro back together in a film, I would've hoped to enjoy it way more than I did. Slow and almost boring, unfortunately, imo. The acting is great, but the movie is just too drawn out.",killerofthemoon
"One of the greatest movies ever made! Martin Scorsese just keeps getting better. The performances are phenomenal, and the story is one of a kind.",killerofthemoon
"A fantastic adaptation of one story of a family of Osage indigenous peoples during their oil boom. Although the run time is tiresome, this movie is typical scorsese.",killerofthemoon
Killers of the flowers review I finally finished it it’s what may remember this movie even more is that Lily won a Golden Globes for it not good ending 2 star 2 out 10 star 10 of 100 star,killerofthemoon
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is a gripping historical drama showcasing stellar performances and an evocative narrative. One of the standout elements is Leonardo DiCaprio's transformation, achieved through prosthetics that alter his appearance dramatically, giving him a permanent frown reminiscent of Orson Welles. DiCaprio's acting reaches its pinnacle in a heart-wrenching scene where he processes the death of his daughter, delivering a performance that feels raw and genuine. Lily Gladstone, however, emerges as the film's most captivating presence. Her expressive eyes communicate a profound depth, keeping the audience guessing whether her character is aware of the sinister plans around her. Gladstone's portrayal adds an air of mystery and emotional weight to the story. Robert De Niro, as expected, is masterful, bringing a duality to his role as a public figure and a Mafia boss, blending menace with charisma. Supporting performances from Jesse Plemons and Brendan Fraser are equally compelling, with Fraser's physicality adding an intimidating dynamic to the courtroom scenes. Martin Scorsese's direction is exemplary, blending his signature style with historical authenticity. The film seamlessly integrates archival photographs and dynamic sequences, such as a memorable scene mixing rock and Native American music during a discovery of oil. The period setting is brought to life through meticulous attention to detail, from vintage cars to cultural nuances, creating a vivid depiction of 1920s America. The narrative also highlights racial tensions and the early days of the FBI, offering a sobering reflection on the era's complexities. Despite its strengths, the film isn't without flaws. Some editing choices, such as continuity errors and a broken 180-degree rule in a conversation, stand out as distractions. DiCaprio's accent, while period-appropriate, feels slightly forced and occasionally pulls focus from the story. At three hours long, the pacing falters at times, particularly in the early sections, which may lose some viewers' engagement. Emotionally, the death of Gladstone's character’s mother fails to resonate as strongly as intended, which detracts from the film's otherwise powerful emotional core. Additionally, DiCaprio's morally corrupt character may surprise viewers expecting a more traditional hero, ultimately shifting the narrative's emotional center to Gladstone. In conclusion, ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" is an ambitious film that succeeds in delivering a compelling story with remarkable performances and meticulous craftsmanship. While not without minor shortcomings, its powerful themes, exceptional acting, and Scorsese's visionary direction make it a memorable cinematic experience.",killerofthemoon
Scorsese at the peak of his powers once again. It’s a long film but it never feels that way. A nice return to form after The Irishman.,killerofthemoon
"Visually very good movie, that explores the dark history of the Osage murders. While the story is compelling, the lengthy runtime is excessive. Overall, it felt boring to me.",killerofthemoon
"Excellent film! It's a little long, but it's worth it. Native Americans have long been cheated, lied to, killed, and stolen from, by the white man. This movie gives you a good idea of what they have endured. I highly recommend that you see this film.",killerofthemoon
"Martin Scorsese makes movies that I usually like this film although long is fun thriller to watch. This film reminds me of the hateful eight by Tarantino but better executed. This film highlight is the performances of the cast all had great moments. Overall, I don't know why films now do 3 hour flick though I would like it in theater but for at home viewing is convenient as I can pause for a break and to Scorsese credit not get lost.",killerofthemoon
"It's a long movie with an incredible story, not heavy on action but full of drama. The performances were excellent, and the emotions really stood out. I'm usually not a big fan of movies these days, but this one was really good.",killerofthemoon
"It is not clear from the title of the film that this is not a classic melodrama. But a quality film with a share of realism, light humor, tragedy and a way of thinking that is not of our time. Excellent acting, a quality plot and atmosphere. For viewing by those who miss the quality of the film, not for viewing while doing something at home out of boredom!",killerofthemoon
"Another great film by the master craftsman, Martin Scorsese. It is unbelievable that he is still at the top of his game at 80 years old. The acting is great, especially in the case of Lily Gladstone. Her performance makes her an instant legend in my eyes. She was given the opportunity to show a wide range of her talent as Mollie Kyle. Robert De Niro, who is also 80 years old, gave one of his career best performances. Leonardo Dicaprio gave an exceptional performance as well. The cinematography is a thing of beauty! The signature Scorsese camera work is something to behold. The way the camera moves seamlessly through the house at a high rate of speed around the 44 minute mark is vintage Martin Scorsese. Him pulling off that shot with those mirrors on the wall is an impressive feat to say the least. I love Martin's cameo appearance at the end of the film. That entire sequence was a rather creative way to update the audience on the years that followed. Rather than simply using inserts, Mr. Scorsese chose to present the story in the style of a stage play, which was really effective, in my opinion. I love the final shot, which shows the resilience of the Osage people with the use of an elevating bird's eye view shot, showing the modern day tribe, dancing and celebrating, leaving the audience with something in the way of a happy ending. Killers of the Flower Moon is a great, yet dark motion picture that is even better upon a second viewing. I most definitely recommend this film. 95/100",killerofthemoon
"Lily Gladstone coloca em cena tudo de si, e entrega o que provavelmente é uma parcela da dor que os povos indígenas podem ter sofrido na corrida do petróleo. A santa ignorância de Ernest, do DiCaprio, é tão rica e convincente, que a mão chega a tremer. E o Robert De Niro, em excelente forma, condensa enorme ambição, frieza e paralelos com o imperialismo que fazem com que tudo ali seja muito mais que um belo filme.",killerofthemoon
"This thing got out of the theaters faster than a testosterone and winstrol fueled Ben Johnson in Seoul, South Korea and after suffering through it I know why. Bobby Ds accent was annoying and utterly unconvincing, I couldn’t tell if he was going for a southern or cajun accent but either way it didn’t work for me. Also, if you put the movie on mute with closed captions and watch his facial expressions and hand movements, you would have thought he was using his NY/NJ Italian schtick. Between the bad accent and confusing facial and hand movements, it was hard for me to focus on the movies plot which played out over 3.5 hours that felt like 6. Unless you are into self punishment, steer clear of this movie.",killerofthemoon
Don’t be scared of the runtime. It feels faster by almost an hour due to the masterful direction of an all-time great Martin Scorsese and the compelling cast.,killerofthemoon
"No character development, no depth, De Caprio just looks too intelligent in his portrayal of a real dumb ass. Simply too flat inspite of the whole tragic and the fact that it’s an historic story. Blood flows for 3 1/2 hours instead of a real psychological analysis of the why and also the prehistory.",killerofthemoon
"Scorsese has directed some of my favourite movies (Goodfellas, Casino and The Wolf of Wall Street) with a superb editor, Thelma Schoonmaker. Thelma, why didn't you rein him in on this offering? It's overlong (like The Irishman) with a confusing, rambling narrative. Come to think of it, the whole effort should have been consigned to the cutting room floor.",killerofthemoon
"A complex story of the Osage murders, and the nascent Federal Bureau of Investigation. Characters are complex and layered, and it's not always easy to tell what motivations exist for each character. A spectacle of a film.",killerofthemoon
Масивне полотно від Скорсезе і перша яскрава та вагома ревізія впливу американців на винищення корінного населення Америки. Про акторський ансамбль і згадувати зайве. Всі дуже сподобались.,killerofthemoon
"It's a long movie, but absolutely fascinating. You would think that with so much time, the pacing would become boring, but that wasn't the case. With the editing, the acting, and even the narrative, it was always smooth and captivating. There was always something happening that caused shifts in the storyline, which kept me hooked throughout the entire journey. In fact, I would dare to say that I didn’t feel the three and a half hours. Literally, they flew by for me. The only thing that didn’t quite convince me was the way they presented the ending, because—although creative—it wasn’t entirely satisfying for me. Maybe they wanted to rush it, considering it was already a very long movie, but I would have been willing to watch another half hour just to see the successive events. Additionally, I’m very happy that Mollie survived and that all the scoundrels paid for their sins. By the way, I also find it fascinating that this happened in real life, and that it was the first major case handled by the newly established FBI under Hoover. It’s not like he had a good reputation, but—at least—in this case, justice prevailed, or something close to justice, since—it seems— they all walked free, regretting their crimes.",killerofthemoon
"I'm honestly not sure if my problem with this movie stems from me first reading the book or that because it is a Martin Scorsese movie that means everyone thinks it's instantly good. Firstly, I'm not sure who decided that this story needed to be told from Ernest's perspective, but that person should be ashamed of their decision. The book was more of a murder mystery non-fiction, and if anything it was mostly from the FBI agent's perspective because it was based off his notes in the actual case. Ernest is a reprehensible, spineless tool, and although the movie demonstrates that at times, it very weirdly tries to get us to empathize with him as well. It makes it seem like he was just a man put in this position and things grew out of his control, but he knew from the beginning what the plan was and went along with it anyway. It also just seems like bad storytelling to me to lay out the perpetrators and plan of this murder plot right from the start, and have the audience watch the police/FBI fumble around while we know exactly what happened. This story was poorly written/adapted, and it doesn't matter that Martin Scorsese was the director or that the acting was amazing because none of that is able to fix a bad screenplay.",killerofthemoon
"O crime contra a Nação Osage sob a perspectiva indígena é o retrato brutal da relação entre os povos originários da América do Norte e o homem branco. Neste drama cruel, Martin Scorcese expõe a ganância desmedida e o perigo combinado a uma fotografia fascinante e um roteiro coerente, que permitem ao cinéfilo uma imersão profunda sobre a maldade humana e a inocência, a quebra de confiança, a traição e o medo.",killerofthemoon
"The story itself is interesting and important, the acting seems pretty good… but it could have been 90 minutes. Someone else mentioned a “forced history lesson” and that’s how it feels to me too. It’s the same thing happening over and over again. Yes it’s sad and emotional and upsetting, but eventually it gets tedious. If I’m to put my pretentious hat on, maybe that’s the point… that we also get numbed to the plight, but it doesn’t quite work if you were already sold on how bad things were from the start.",killerofthemoon
"An excellent entry in Martin's collection with a great story and amazing acting. Even though it is long, it is very tense and gripping while proving that the western genre still has plenty of life in it when paired with the right people.",killerofthemoon
"The movie is very well done, but difficult to watch what happened to this community. The movie is long and could have benefited from editing/tightening.",killerofthemoon
"This has everything - grief, horror, joy, humor, sadness, greed, ignorance, evil - and made me feel every emotion. The beginning and the score had me thinking this was going to be one thing and then it becomes very clear it is not_going_to_be_that - there is nothing fun about this story of genocide. It is full of incredible performances - Lily Gladstone is understated yet captivating, Robert DeNiro is pure satan, and Leo brilliantly portrays a bumbling, but complicit, fool. Also, the haunting yet beautiful dream / hallucination scenes were a stand out, and I won’t spoil, but I loved the way it ended. My main critique, likely not surprising, is that it had no business being 3.5 hours long; the first 2 hours were so rich and had me glued to the screen, but in the last 1.5 hours I was really struggling to focus and felt frustrated. Could have been perfect at 2.5 hours. “I learned my lesson king” “Can you spot the wolves in this picture?”",killerofthemoon
"Stunning, shocking, brutal and beautiful, but my goodness it’s LONG . Cannot believe if it had been an hour shorter that much would have been lost.",killerofthemoon
I’m a huge fan of DiCaprio but this film was pure garbage. One of few movies I had to turn off before finishing it because it was so boring.,killerofthemoon
"The story is interesting but 3 hours and mid for a story that should be ended 2 hours after we see Apple logo, it is no.",killerofthemoon
"Love a good Scorsese film but this one was not his finest, without spoiling anything it had a strange ending that left me going oh is that it?",killerofthemoon
Great movie. Most people would never know about the massacre if this movie was not made. I don’t know why so many hate this movie,killerofthemoon
"Impeccably made, with masterful direction from a seasoned director, giving us the impression that decades of learning, growing, and mastering his craft can provide us a monumental, sprawling, 3+hrs epic that feels more like it's 2hrs and a bit long, with plenty to soak in, and plenty to reward a return to the film over time. Whilst there is a deft approach to treating the osage culture with the harsh realism of what they faced at the time, there is something vacant, a slight void, perhaps the actual scale of the murders themselves felt a little downplayed. Nonetheless, a must-watch.",killerofthemoon
"Retrata triste e lindamente o Massacre da Tribo Osage, os indígenas mais ricos das Américas, devido ao Petróleo em suas terras, a ambição humana desmedida e maligna… Produção fantástica, um roteiro apaixonante, apesar das 3h e pouca (que eu sempre assisto numa velocidade aceleradinha para acompanhar meu ritmo), o filme flui lindamente, que tampouco percebemos sua longa durabilidade… O desfecho real foi ainda mais triste, os larápios pegaram pena curta e viveram muito, no ostracismo, Mollie tb...",killerofthemoon
"This is a great movie but it is very slow placed and detailed. I enjoyed it and felt the acting from DiCaprio and De Niro was spot on. Martin Scorsese wanted to do the story justice, and I believe he did that. This might be unpopular opinion, but I think this would have made a better two part movie or perhaps a series on Apple TV. I enjoyed it, but at times, it was hard to stay focused and sit still when such a long run time. If you watch it in theaters, you have to prepare yourself. Definitely worth a watch, however, if you struggle with long movies, maybe wait for streaming.",killerofthemoon
"*slight spoliers* Another brilliant memorable flick from Scorsese, the director really does not know how to do mediocrity. De Niro is fantastic as always and his portrayal as the sociopathic calculated William Hale ranks as one of his most despicable characters in his acting career. Leonardo also plays the ever pliable Ernest well. It’s a long runtime but it never gets dull, I feel the 3 hour plus runtime was justified as it immerses you into the story well. It is a very melancholy film, it’s terrible what some humans will do to one another in the name of greed. A masterpiece of a film that would probably sit in the number 1 spot for films I’ve seen this year.",killerofthemoon
"Good film from beginning to end, I still personally like some of his other movies more though. Scorsese is the best biopic director ever, I truly think so.",killerofthemoon
"Not as impressed as I thought I might be with the movie, especially after reading the book and being very impressed with it. This is indeed a tragic story and obviously a little known tragic story, but people go to the movies to be entertained so it's hard to think of this as entertainment. It's almost like a forced history lesson. I thought it was too long and belabored. The level of corruption and evil it took to systematically defraud and murder on the part of all of those involved is almost unbelievable. Martin Scorcese's heart is in the right place in bringing the book to light but I don't know that it got the job done.",killerofthemoon
"I have been waiting almost a year to watch this film. Still only available to purchase a digital copy for 24.99 cad, which they can take from you as they feel like. I want to rent. I don't want to buy. It was released last year. The GREED OF APPLE IS WILD. Guess I'll be pirating. Thx.",killerofthemoon
"Based on a true story, Scorsese’s latest outing tells the tale of a 1920’s Oklahoma family that tries to “inherit” Osage Indian land by marrying the landowners and then murdering them. This was news to me, but yeah, that really happened. Apparently, something like 60 Osage Indians were murdered over the course of a decade in these schemes, leading the U.S. Government to change laws regarding inheritance of Native American land. Unfortunately, the film is just too damn long. Clocking in at three and a half hours, it takes an interesting premise and just drags it out to the point of being boring. This seems to be an unexpected consequence of the streaming era. In the old days, studios were a lot more demanding with filmmakers when it came to runtime. This ensured they could get as many daily showings in a cinema as possible. With more viewers waiting to stream films, runtime seems to be less important to studios, allowing filmmakers to indulge to the detriment of their own films. Leaving an hour of this one on the cutting room floor would have benefited this film immensely.",killerofthemoon
"Speechless but not in a good way. The brutal story of how the Natives were victims of American colonialism and genocide needs to be told. However, I do not think this film did it justice. While it showed how truly awful people can be, well that’s all it shows. Only in the last 5 minutes showed the resilience of Osage people. The rest of the film is them getting gruesomely murdered, swindled, and being bred/married for money and to be ethnically cleansed/killed by their spouses. All the characters were truly one-dimensional with De Niro being as solely heinous and egomaniacal as the devil himself, and DiCaprio being very seemingly stupid and having no redeeming qualities. [SPOILERS AHEAD] … He goes along with and participates without needing much coercion from De Niro. He seemingly never has a moral dilemma to be honest to his wife or at least not POISON her. Sure he acted sweet in front of her while behind her back he was committing evil acts but to me it makes him less likable. Not only is he a murderous thief, he pretends to be a sweet loving husband while killing her family. The gratification of seeing justice to the bad guys is overshadowed by the long run time and unfortunately is not gratifying at all. We see Lily Gladstone’s character finally show some resistance to DiCaprio in the very end, and I like how she just walked away with poise, it was true to her character, but honestly she deserved much more. I cannot believe she didn’t kill him in that field but embraced him. There was no way she did not know he was guilty at that point. Particularly because she was well enough to meet him in the field. I know “rose colored glasses” but he was never that great of a husband and he killed your family and tried to kill you. She knew this I believe, otherwise that would make her very ignorant. She is the ultimate victim who loses truly everything. We only hope her life after this was peaceful, but we don’t know for sure. All we get is a obituary. We don’t know what became of the Osage people or how they fought back. Or how we could support indigenous people today",killerofthemoon
"This is an important story, and it will certainly reach a wider audience as a DiCaprio film than as a documentary. That said, it's not the kind of movie you want to reach for unless you're in the mood to be mad about real life injustices.",killerofthemoon
"Read the book first. I was disappointed in the movie. They spend so much time on all the murders, that they skipped over the FBI portion. The murders were important but so was the investigation.",killerofthemoon
Very slow. Scorsese did a nice job with the scenery/set but this movie did not live up to the hype of his previous movies. Waiting for the next Scorcese film which is always a must see.,killerofthemoon
Killer Of The Flower Moon is a lengthy but also interesting true-crime movie about a massacre that people need to remember and be told about because of it still happening to this very day behind closed doors. Because genocide happening all over the world at this very moment! Movies like this are need now more than ever. With great acting especially from Lily Gladstone with her bringing this devastating performance as she watch her tribe and family be killed around her slowly with her having no one left expect her husband only for Ernest to backstab her and slowly poison her with insulin since he puts,killerofthemoon
"I found this to be a well acted and engaging film, but WAYYY too long. In the end, the film commits the greatest crime any screenplay can commit, and that is a series of characters that you really don't care about one bit. Nobody to root for, nobody to root against, The story is good, the historical context is excellent, but you eventually discover that you don't care what happens to any of them, and after three plus hours, that leaves you feeling cheated. Worth a viewing, ONCE.",killerofthemoon
too drawn out way too long reminded me of the irishman took me 2 nights to finish good acting weird ending ok film to watch on apple tv ok worth watching once,killerofthemoon
Although 3 and 1/2 hours we split it over two nights. Such a great cast. Leonardo did a tremendous performance. And Lily Gladstone was standout.,killerofthemoon
This is a crime movie from a director who has given us many crime movies. This is one is similar in some ways to his last films but is wrapped in a completely different cloth in a way that is refreshing and intriguing,killerofthemoon
"Probably the worst movie I’ve seen since Covid. I normally love Leonardo DiCaprio in movies, but he put himself (or someone put him) in the wrong role in this one. The absolute worst acting was from Robert De Niro though. I’ve seen better acting in high school plays. Probably time to retire. The story is one that needed to be told in a movie because I don’t think many are aware of what happened to the Osage in Oklahoma.",killerofthemoon
"Iba con las expectativas muy altas y me ha decepcionado un poco. Las 3h y media no están justificadas, hay mucho relleno y la tama se desarrolla algo lenta. Los escenarios y los efectos especiales están bien conseguidos.",killerofthemoon
"This 3.5 hour movie should've been 2.5 hours, AT MOST. Scorcese really burries the lead with a lot of wasted time on conversations that do not matter, and could've been cut in half. The real plot of the movie really doesn't take off until 55 minutes into the movie, which leaves you feeling baffled that nearly an hour's gone by without cutting to the chase yet. Also, the intentions of Leo's character are baddly muddled. What's going on between he, Deniro, and the forgettable cowboy characters is laid out for the audience, but the mindset of the main character between his allegiances is badly obscured.

Great acting my everyone. Leonardo gave me chills with his dark character. One of Apples best piece of work in theatre. I saw on IMAX and everything about it was perfect.,killerofthemoon
"O filme é muito bom, as várias horas presente no filme é explicado pela narrativa do filme, ele é lento porque precisa ser lento. A história contado no filme é muito interessante. Recomendo.",killerofthemoon
"The first 2 or 3 minutes were interesting and all. Then, while the film has barely even begun, a montage of people dancing pops up. It's not accompanied by credits or any helpful information about the backstory, just music and dancing. I can't critique the rest of the film because I have no tolerance for this nonsense. I thought maybe the 3+ hour runtime might have been justified by a *story* that required that much time to tell. That may have been mostly true, but I'm not going to ffw a film just to ""get to the good parts"". That's basically selfserve censorship. I don't believe in censorship, not because violence, nudity and cussing are necessary to be included, but because they're part of the filmmaker's manner of communicating with the audience. If I'm in the middle of saying something and I get interrupted for using a word someone doesn't like, I'm probably going to just quit talking. If a movie is truly worth making, it should not be censored. If it's not worth making... Well, that's entirely subjective, but bottom line is I'm giving this film 3 stars for the benefit of the doubt because selfserve censorship is the only thing that could make this film tolerable.",killerofthemoon

"Oppenheimer won all the Oscars, but in my opinion, this was the finest film of 2023 and will be looked back at as one of the films of the decade, much like 'Munich' was retrospectively viewed in the 00s.",killerofthemoon
"Scorcese has an incredible knack for crime-drama that will forever influence the genre. Here we have an overlong epic that does excuse it's length with top-notch storytelling and performances. Dicaprio's simpleton ought not to have been overlooked by the Academy. It's one of his strongest performances with subtle character acting that really shines. Lily Gladstone is stoic and sweet, you instantly care about her character very much which makes the business of her slow, painful death after witnessing the tragic deaths of her family members incredibly engaging and challenging. Any drama with something to say should challenge you. Robert Deniro is also top-form here as a manipulative, power hungry man who puppeteers murders and wipes his hands clean with the callous menace that only an actor of his caliber could convey. It could have been tightened up, however, easily 30 minutes could have gone from the film bringing it to a more acceptable 3 hour runtime.",killerofthemoon
"Phenomenal acting, visuals, and story. The 3.5 hour runtime is difficult and I fell asleep the first time watching it. It pulls no punches and gets its message across. Amazing work by Scorsese. Lily Gladstone was robbed of an Oscar for this one.",killerofthemoon
"Too long, one dimensional characters : De Niro is the villain playing like a constipated old man, De Caprio playing the pawn in De Niro's game crying at his wife's bedside while trying to kill her very slooooowwy as directed by Martin, sorry, De Niro. And Lily Gladstone is playing the dying wife. The whole thing over 3.5 hours where nothing else happens. No tension, no character development, no pay off in the ending. A complete waste of time except from the depicting of the little known Osage society in the 20s.",killerofthemoon
"Way to long and could have easily edited out 45 minutes of meandering. There is nothing challenging for DeNiro with these types of roles, but after 50 years its a little understandable. A little rambling and laboured and at times overly melodramatic. Perhaps a two part series would have been a better vehicle for this.",killerofthemoon
"Estar despierto desde las 5 de la mañana para ir a trabajar, desvelado y crudo, con una jornada bastante agotadora, luego tomar el transporte para ir al cine, que este lo cierren debido a un incendio y tener que ir a otro cine, mis expectativas para esta película era de que me iba a quedar bien dormido en algún punto, caso que me ocurrió viendo The Irishman, pero a pesar de la adversidad, fue una increíble película que valió literalmente toda la pena.",killerofthemoon
"Watching the film had me looking at my watch more than a dozen times! Scorsese has sold out his talent- period. He can't even turn in a film less than three and a half hours! I don't know what was worse- Deniro sucking on a lemon throughout or DiCaprio pledging his undying love to Lily Gladstone while he is having her entire family murdered. Both main actors were completely miscast and were even more horrible to watch than what took place. Gladstone was good, but they had her dying for half the movie! It was just too depressing to watch! Completely wastes the otherwise fine supporting cast and set design, which is a shame, because Flower Moon is extremely well-made period piece. It is a well-documented film about the Osage people yet it's just three and a half hours of horror to sit through. The victims of the Osage massacre deserved better than a director who forget how to edit a movie! Oh did I forget the ending where Scorsese steps into the picture like some game show host- what an ego! Made me yearn for his 70's films.",killerofthemoon
"Obviously the pace is slow, but that's part of the narrative. The photography and film work is sublime. It tells a story from different angles and viewpoints and in a way that eventually draws you in. I think Robert de Niro is the stand out actor though Lily Gladstone gets many plaudits. She just remains stoically inscrutable all the time. I liked it but it obviously is a Marmite movie.",killerofthemoon
"What on earth...... It just didn't need to be this long. I fast forwarded to the end. The lingering talks and pauses. Ridiculous. Could have been done better. Disappointing especially for how much money it cost to make. It's a true story and one that needs to be seen, heard and remembered but ruined by silly directing and bad editing.",killerofthemoon
"This movie tells a very sad story. It's shot beautifully, but it's really slow and long. The writing, directing is quite good, while the acting is amazing, especially from Lily Gladstone, but there were no relatable characters, everybody wanted the land, the oil and the money. This is based on a true story, so it's not the fault of the writing, but I need one character that I can root for. The cinematography and visual effects make this movie look really good, but it could have used much more editing. This movie is way too long. It's really slow too and this a very bad combo. This movie is good, but far from perfect.",killerofthemoon
"Way too long of a build-up. My wife and I watched it over two days, because who's got time to sit through 3-1/2 hours in one night? After the very slow burn that was the first 90 minutes, my wife was unmotivated to watch the rest. I think we forced ourselves to do it because ""Oscar nominated."" The film certainly got more interesting in the back half, but the ultimate payoff was weak. I would have liked to see the villainous characters get what was coming to them. Instead, I got an innovative old-time radio show description of what happened to them. The presentation was interesting, particularly for someone who enjoys listening to old-time radio show podcasts. But as someone else noted, it was effectively a glorified caption. As I sit here now I realize I didn't feel a strong connection to any of the characters, not even Lilly. I simply didn't care. I didn't feel any emotion, which is a shame as the subject matter should have been deeply emotional. The movie gets high marks for sound, visuals (costumes/sets/etc) and cinematography. But overall, it's not one I'll ever return to, and there's very little from the film that will stick with me. Five years from now, it will be one of those movies I barely remember watching.",killerofthemoon
"God may let you do your wicked deeds for a while, but he makes sure that the end of all these is your destruction, unless you repent. Another epic film by prolific filmmaker Martin Scorsese, this 2023 historical crime drama of the murders of the Osage Indians during the 1900s is long but thoroughly engaging and captivating throughout, with excellent direction, script, cinematography, music, and performances, esp. of Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone.",killerofthemoon
"This movie was way too long. I think in the duration of watching it, I fell asleep 10 times. Acting was good. Lily Gladstone is good in this and I'm sure a lot of people were upset that she didn't get an Oscar for it. But honestly. Emma stone deserved it over this. Lily played herself basically crying and sick in bed in most of the movie.",killerofthemoon
"While this is one of the less impressive and less favorite Scorsese movies of mine that I've seen and while the plot sometimes gets a little too distracted with its story-telling for its own good (mainly with the crimes and characters), there are several good things. I always love Leonardo DiCaprio's acting plus Scorsese's directing and quality production behind the scenes, and the dramatic moments that aren't easy to forget. Lily Gladstone gave a pretty good performance as well. While the film goes on for quite some time, you become invested enough and I did not know much about this story and what happened with this event and so I was more surprised when it ended the way it did.",killerofthemoon
"3.5 hours wasted waiting for this movie to improve. Yes, Lily Gladstone is great in this drawn out movie. In fact most of the acting is good, but my God… editing! It could have easily been an hour shorter. I have no problem sitting through a well made movie. I've seen the Longest Day, Gone with the Wind and Lord of the Rings trilogy several times, but the length of this drawn out movie was torturous at times.",killerofthemoon
"The film dives into a true-crime story set in 1920s Oklahoma, centering on the mysterious murders of members of the Osage Nation after they discovered oil on their land. Expect a suspenseful drama with twists and turns as it explores themes of greed, corruption, and historical injustice. The movie may be 3 hours and 30 minutes long, but its not boring at all.",killerofthemoon
A twisted love story in the midst of a ruthless takeover. This is a story that pictures the dawn of a system that's fuelled with greed and bloodshed. Performances by the whole cast was amazingly sharp. Great visuals and cinematography that contrast the booming oil business to the harmony in the green seas of Indian lands. Great audio effects that plays a major role in the movie. There's documentaries that dives deeper into history but Killers of the Moon reanimate the history of the minority's struggle to survive in an invasion. Sincerity in performances were a true gift that no one should keep from unraveling.,killerofthemoon
A very intriguing movie. Was entertained the whole time!! And man what an ending! Leonardo Dicaprio and Lily Gladstone absolutely kills there roles. Very well done,killerofthemoon
"I regret very much not walking out after maximum 90 minutes because this movie should've not been that much longer than that, and even then I don't think it could've been as interesting as it tries to be. I kept waiting for it to get better for the entire 3.5 hour runtime but it never did. It definitely has things going for it. The acting is phenomenal - although the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone is very unconvincing and superficial - and the cinematography gorgeous. The subject matter is very important and it's good that it's being brought to attention. Having said that, it's quite simply boring. I love a good slow burner as much as the next man - considering There Will Be Blood to be possibly my favourite movie, for example - but the film does not offer enough substance to merit its runtime. The entire movie rests on the relationship between Leo and Lily and as said before, it's just not convincing. It ultimately crumbles under its own ambition, which is a shame considering the tour de force team behind it, but unlike The Irishman, this is just not the magnificent masterpiece Scorsese tried to conceive. It'll certainly be good and enjoyable for certain people, but I think most people will find it at least 90 minutes too long and devoid of substance.",killerofthemoon
"I was very surprised at just how bad this movie was. Ponderous and slow are the two main adjectives I would use. The first 90 minutes, yes 90, should have been completely redone. Characters would come in have 5 seconds on screen, then die sometime later and you would have no clue who they were or at least why you should care. good acting alone cannot make a good movie. It is a real shame as the story of the Osage people is one that should be told, just in a much better way. And the ending? just horrible, 3.5 hours and no payoff just a glorified caption really. Martin Scorsese has made many great films; this is not one of them.",killerofthemoon
"It is valuable since it touches on a subject that is not explored well enough. However, cinematically, it is just another Scorsese movie that embeds the same kind of mafia story. Probably the worst Di Caprio performance I have seen. It might be the case that his character was like that though.",killerofthemoon
I don't understand how in almost 4 hrs there was virtually no character development or depth given to any of the characters. I was so excited to see this...what an enormous disappointment.,killerofthemoon
"Another Brilliant one from scorsese . I am writing this review after oscar ceremony. I thought there'd be a battle between KOTFM and oppenheimer;But unfortunately, oppenheimer swept away all of them. However, KOTFM was a great movie to watch. It was a bit longer but too good. How marty showcased the indians it was brilliant. The soundtrack was phenomenal. After reading the book by David Grann, I felt this is the perfect adaption. If i talk about the screenplay, it was a bit longer but tremendous. For the sake of character development,the runtime was a bit longer. Talking about performances, I felt neither de niro nor leo was the show stealer. It was lily gladstone who was amazing and you will fall in love with her. Her expressions and acting was so on point that i felt really engaged with the character. I should note the performance of jesse plemons who is a brilliant actor and did his best in short screen time . Overall, I feel it's a must watch.",killerofthemoon

Insulting that such an important and evocative film didn't receive the rewards and attention! On my favorite list forever. A must watch! Recommend to everyone.,killerofthemoon
"I really just don't get the hype around the movie. I'm sure it does a great job honoring Osage culture and the time period etc…but it felt to me like there was all this focus on details and along the way they forgot how to make an interesting movie. The story is about a string of murders and how this case helped legitimize the FBI, but there's no whodunnit. They put everything out in front…HERES THE EVIL PEOPLE SOING EVIL! Ok so then I would suppose it's supposed to be a character study, but the movie is so much Deniro and DiCaprio and Deniros character has no nuance as a big baddie, just a run of the mill greedy baron type, no secret underlying motivations, just greed. Meanwhile DiCaprio plays his same old ""young man looking to make a name for himself struggling against a society or system that doesn't quite accept him"" role he's done over and over….plus he basically just wears this same one dumb look on his face the whole movie. Jesse Plemmons was a breath of fresh air once he was finally introduced (understated and some great nuanced emotion in his performance). Overall just felt like all sides and no entree and it's getting rave reviews because Scorsese gets rave reviews just by showing up.",killerofthemoon
"Highly ""hyped"" production , mostly due to the most famous actors in this film however , it's too long and too slow in its telling of the story .

"Killers of the Flower Moon is a crime western that is adapted from the book of the same name, telling the story of The Osage Murders and how the events occurred. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone in the leads as Ernest and Mollie Burkhart. The movie also stars Robert De Niro, Brendan Fraser and is directed by the infamous Martin Scorsese. Just like many people going into this movie, I didn't know anything about this true story and these events that took place but the trailer intrigued me enough and after a few tries of watching this 3 and a half hour movie, I can happily say that this movie is what cinema is all about. The performances in this movie are no joke and are some of the best acting from an ensemble in a long time. The chemistry between DiCaprio and Gladstone felt so organic and natural, and when the intense drama took place, they both knew how to perfectly deliver their performances. The atmosphere and cinematography in this movie was beautiful, and the best scenes that showed this was probably the opening, or this one scene with an explosion. But most importantly, the story is incredible. I mean, the amount of detail that was put into this story when showing the different points of views and making sure to tell every aspect of the story with such dedication and thoughtfulness is what makes this movie such a masterpiece. The way Scorsese executes certain scenes with this slow pacing that makes up for it with world-building, and telling the story in a way where it's easy to understand and dissect, while also making it entertaining, suspenseful. emotional, and satisfying with the conclusion to this heartbreaking story, it's really incredible and inspiring to see such a true story be brought to the big screen in such a fantastic way. Overall, Killers of the Flower Moon tells a true and real story in an entertaining and suspenseful way, filled with intense drama, incredible performances, this a movie that will be legendary for sure. A-",killerofthemoon
"Evident mastery but moderately below his peak, Scorsese's knack for suitably elaborate complex stories continues onto a different, more indigenous terrain with equal deft approach and stellar vision under particularly crafted focus whilst benefitting from excellently-casted performances that elevated the tedious duration. (B+)",killerofthemoon
"Truly disliked this movie. I am certainly not a professional, but have an appreciation for film-making and also DO NOT MIND a long movie if it's entertaining. This was boring, drawn out, over indulgent, and just not interesting. Critics are too afraid to say so because they're afraid to upset Scorsese.",killerofthemoon
My god someone please take the cameras away from Martin. There is absolutely no reason this movie needed to be 3.5 hours. The acting is good and the quality overall is all well done but it’s not enough to justify the movie in the first place. It feels like the academy felt obligated to include this as a best picture nominee for whatever reason. Most over rated director in Hollywood.,killerofthemoon

"Killers of the Flower Moon This epic western crime saga recounts the tale of the Osage people in 1920, whose newfound wealth from oil discovery on their land brought both prosperity and a wave of violence and death. ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" presents a grim examination of how individuals, driven by greed and cowardice, can commit heinous acts. Ernest Burkhart witnesses his uncle's ruthless killings of the Osage people for their wealth and becomes complicit in these atrocities. As the violence seeps into his own home, he remains indifferent, even contemplating ending his wife's life despite his love for her. Despite its lengthy runtime of three and a half hours, the film maintains tight pacing throughout. While it delves deep into the lives of the Osage people, it also explores the broader circumstances surrounding them, offering a comprehensive view of the events that shaped their lives. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a fully committed portrayal of his character; Ernest embodies both heartlessness and cowardice with chilling authenticity. Robert De Niro, true to form, delivers a stellar performance. Lily Gladstone's portrayal of Mollie stands out as one of the 'daintiest' performances I've witnessed. Despite her character, Mollie, not delivering monologues or extravagant expressions, her gentle demeanor exudes life and commands attention effortlessly. She serves as a brilliant representation of the positive values inherent in her tribe. Martin Scorsese's direction is immersive, and atmospheric, and demands patience from the audience. With meticulous detail, he resurrects a forgotten incident, shedding light on it with painstaking care. While ""Killers of the Flower Moon"" may pose a challenge due to its lengthy runtime, for those willing to weather the storm, it offers a blend of education and entertainment. 8/10",killerofthemoon
"Adapted from David Grann's 2017 nonfiction book of the same name, ""Killers Of The Flower Moon"" finds director/co-writer Martin Scorsese yet again pushing against the bounds of a normative runtime for the purposes of narrative scope and the study of American moral degradation. Like ""The Irishman"" before it, I'm fighting real hard to try and justify the length of this in my head, but it's just a little too long. Interestingly, though, this did feel a bit shorter than that 2019 effort, even with the two being roughly the same length. Could be this one had a livelier wrap-up, but I digress. What a well-realized epic this was. De Niro, DiCaprio, Plemons; all bring their A-game here, but make no mistake -- this was the Lily Gladstone show for me. The amount of strength, poise and stoicism that she brought to this role is so beyond impressive. So cool to see someone previously regarded as an ""under the radar"" indie performer finally getting some mainstream exposure and regard. Hope we'll be seeing her in more things after this. Honestly gotta recommend everyone watch this for the historical significance alone (even if you gotta do so in installments). Of course, it helps that one of the greatest living filmmakers is at the helm of things. Not a regrettable watch in any way other than having to witness the harrowing conduct depicted.",killerofthemoon

"Adapted from David Grann's book of the same name that investigates the calculated murders of affluent Osage people at Osage County, Oklahoma, in the early 1920s, for their headrights to oil deposits, Martin Scorsese delivers a solemn moving eulogy that ends nimbly with a radio drama that recounts the fate of the characters and an overhead shot of a present-day Osage powwow dancing circle.",killerofthemoon
"Opera mastodontica di Martin Scorsese che, come ormai sempre ha fatto nelle sue ultime fatiche da regista, crea un prodotto imponente senza minimamente curarsi della lunga durata. Ovviamente di prim'ordine la fotografia e la musica, di altissimo livello e senza mai pecche. La sceneggiatura introduce subito i personaggi e l'inizio della trama, con una fretta non del tutto in linea con il resto del film molto più compassato nei tempi e negli eventi. Storia assolutamente interessante ed unica, che merita di essere raccontata e che viene raccontata con immenso tatto da un lato ma allo stesso tempo con la giusta rappresentazione della ferocia e dell'avidità ""bianca"" dall'altro. Peccato, con il tempo a disposizione, non essersi addentrati meglio nella psicologia dei personaggi; scelta mirata che però viene parzialmente disinnescata da alcuni momenti effettivamente un po' lenti. Finale molto intenso ed emozionante, che rende giustizia al mastodontico racconto.",killerofthemoon
"Leo and Bob are two evil conniving a-holes in this movie. Scorsese does a good job of showing how the crimes in this movie committed are indirect. Sneaky. I'd have preferred he have the Osage be a lot smarter. They are shown as really stupid. Ruined the movie. Still, I enjoyed it anyway.",killerofthemoon

Durée : 3h26 Mon ressenti : C'est un bon film, qui malgré l'énorme durée, arrive à te tenir en haleine pendant 3h26. Il réussit notamment un tour de passe-passe scénaristique super intéressant de te faire détester le personnage principal sans pour autant te faire détester le film.

"Great movies build throughout and peak in a way with a payoff that is satisfying. This does the opposite. It starts off at the peak and just slowly goes downhill for 3 hours. What can I say? It was another, slow as f**k Morten Scorsese movie that has zero re-watchability just like The Irishman. I fell asleep twice during the movie. Scorsese took a really good idea and drew it out WAY too long. This needed to be a 2 hour movie. No real character development and the De Niro/DiCaprio relationship is just like every other Scorsese film. The last hour was brutal.",killerofthemoon
Slow moving. It takes three and a half hours to tell a two-hour tale. The victims are treated like pawns while the crooks go about being nasty. Maybe Scorsese is getting too old for storytelling. An hour had me bored. The following two and a half was more of the same. Even the killings got boring. The finale as a radio show was not a saving grace but a device for ridicule.,killerofthemoon
"Killers of the Flower Moon portrays a horrific true story about greed and murder. I was shocked by the events and dismayed by how long these crimes went uninvestigated. I was particularly impressed by Lily Gladstone, who is able to show off a range of acting talents. And Leonardo DiCaprio plays his role of Ernest Burkhart in a way that makes him both sympathetic and despicable. That being said, I feel like no one is able to tell Martin Scorsese no these days, and so he just leaves in everything he wants and doesn't feel the need to trim things down. It's a solid film, bogged down by the runtime.",killerofthemoon
Superb. Exhaustively researched for historical accuracy this film is a tour de force that makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of this shameful period of our history.,killerofthemoon
"El tema por sí mismo tiene relevancia y resulta interesante, el doble binomio Scorsese-De Niro y Scorsese-Di Caprio, que en tantas buenas películas ha funcionado, pone en un lugar especial a esta producción y la realización termina entregando un gran resultado. A destacar, además de lo ya mencionado el excelente trabajo de fotografía del mexicano Rodrigo Prieto. Yo le hubiera editado unos 30 minutos de algunas secuencias muy largas y algo lentas, aunque entiendo el objetivo de establecer muy bien lo terrorífico que debió ser este periodo para la tribu de los Osage. Vale mucho la pena (aunque la veas en dos sesiones, como hice yo 😬)",killerofthemoon
"Martin Scorsese does it again with Killers of the flower moon. An amazing directed and acted film with a tragic, gripping true story of the Osage murders.

It could have been trimmed down just ever so slightly. That said, this is a great piece of cinema.",killerofthemoon

Still, Scorcese did it beautifully- the soundtrack was great, the visuals were stunning, and the length of the movie was needed to tell this story properly and give it due respect.

"Leonardo DiCaprio's character is so two-dimensional and his back-story/motivation pretty thoroughly unexplained. It's absolutely inexcusable, considering that they had over 3 hours in which to do so. Otherwise, the care and cultural accuracy to the Osage people and to this important story is excellent and important.",killerofthemoon
"It doesn't need to be that long. Repetitive, lacks drama, no suspense. A 1 hour documentary would've been far more entertaining. It looked and sounded good and the acting was fine but it was still a very unrewarding watch. Everything was given to the audience on a plate from the start and we just had to wait 3 hours for it to finally play out. Zero rewatch value.",killerofthemoon
"I got 1.5 hours in and I don't care about any character or plotline. There is almost no attempt at real character development. The relationships between characters are not explored in any meaningful way. This movie does a horrible job telling a story that should be compelling and meaningful. With the total runtime, the movie could have really gone deeply into a compelling story with complex characters. Instead, the time is wasted, and the characters are incredibly shallow, one-note avatars used solely to get through a very ""and then"" storyline. I expected much better from this director. These talented actors were wasted (but gave good performances with what they had).",killerofthemoon
"I enjoyed it, saw another side if history I had zero idea about. However I think there might have been an error in hyping the movie as much as they did. The whole time I'm waiting to be wow'd. I was not. Good mood. Not great.",killerofthemoon
"I don't understand why this movie was given such praise. If not for the director and huge actors no one would consider this a ""masterpiece"". Yet another band wagon film that viewers claim to love. Of course the acting is great, the cast is extremely talented, but that does not create a good film on its own. The story should be told but my personal opinion is that they really missed the mark. It might have served better as a documentary and not a feature film.",killerofthemoon
It was slow and boring. Not too mention it's just bad guys winning the whole movie. It was just really depressing watching such greedy people with no conscience and no appreciation for life.,killerofthemoon
This same story has been told time and time again. Acting was terrific as you'd expect from some of the stars but the stories just been done to many times. Didn't hold my attention.,killerofthemoon
"Unreasonably long and slow. Could have benefit from good editing. The plot is given away at the start, and then on repeat for next 2.5 hrs to get to sth interesting.",killerofthemoon
"3 and a half hours plus 10 Oscar nominations, it's really cool in the details of tradition, telling the brutal truth of history, the cruel heart of man, sequencing work that looks like it was in a real event. It's a pity that the investigative part would have added more issue, more complicated and vague than this.",killerofthemoon
"Tremendous acting here, but an overly-long story that should have been severely edited way down from its 3 and a half hour excessive run-time. Asking moviegoers today to sit in one place for that length of time is kind of dubious at best these days when so many people would much rather watch this at their own pace in the comfort of their own home where they can pause this for bathroom, cell phone, and snack breaks. Love Scorcese and you get the very best from DiCaprio and Gladstone as expected along with solid work from De Niro in addition to some terrific cinematography and well chosen sound direction. The story though, much as I tried my best to really get into the characters and the main story-line, I really struggled to love this one and I think the tremendous praise thrown at it all over the media played into me going in with even higher expectations then usual for a Martin Scorcese film which it just never really lived up to. I do love most of all that this kind of vehicle is going to open doors everywhere now for actors like Lilly Gladstone raised in places like Blackfeet Reservations.",killerofthemoon
Martin Scorsese goes back to the cinematic triumph of Killers of the Flower Moon -- an epic crime saga based on non-fiction book details a series of gruesome murders of every members of the wealthiest Osage Nation in 1920's Oklahoma fueled by oil and greed.,killerofthemoon
"The music underscoring - literally - this masterpiece remains in my head, as does the lead actress' Lily Gladstone's mona lisa face, robert de niro's magnificent evil, leo's road to ruin .. stunningly filmed in true 'cinema' style. Scorcese forever.",killerofthemoon
"I heard the story of Osage before and was excited to finally see the film. The cast is truly great, the film was a disappointment. The characters are exaggerated and shallow, film unreasonably slow. It swings between kitchy American pathos and an eerie zombie movie. We didn't even finish watching it. There needs to be another take at the amazing story of Osage. Maybe a young native american director should give it a go.",killerofthemoon
Holy cow this move could have been an hour long and you still could get the point. Robert should just retire he is just awful. This movie was soooo boring. If you feel like you want to be bored out of your mind for three hours then watch this train wreck,killerofthemoon
"A story with enormous potential wasted with a bad script. The film drags on for almost two hours, showing many scenes of everyday life and few of murder. So, the investigation, which is the most interesting part of the real story, was compressed into less than an hour of film. Finally, the ending, the staging of which would have been much more exciting to watch than the entire everyday life at the beginning, was narrated in a radio program that conveyed no emotion whatsoever. Overall, the image is given that Ernest Burkhart was more of a victim of his uncle than a criminal, which is a dangerous message. This film could have had an immense cultural impact if the story had been told from the point of view of the Osage, rather than their killers.",killerofthemoon
"A Scorsese slow burn thar gnaws at you all the way to the end. While De Niro's accent is, well, not worth the attempt, the performances all around were noteworthy.",killerofthemoon
How to turn a great story into a boring and unnecessarily long and slow picture with expression-less actors and ridiculous soundtrack and flashbacks. Too much money to spend in the wrong hands.,killerofthemoon
"Thoroughly enjoyed all the way through in a time when you feel anxious about the film length. When you think your uncertainty would be concerning justice, which you definitely are, you are truly engulfed by the protagonist's relationship and their feelings toward each other.",killerofthemoon
"Extremely well done, although I thought it could have been less than 3 hours. I didn't care for the changes from the book, but the story is basically what people need to know. One of the horrors of American history.",killerofthemoon
"Too long & too overrated. .. Big Cast, with a couple surprises: DeNiro seemed uncharacteristically nice as the evil ol' man. Plus hardly recognized Lithgow & Brendan Frasier. I dictated a lot of ruff notes, so see those. The scenery seemed authentic. What interested me was that my Grandpa brought the family up from North Texas, stayed a while in Oklahoma about then, befo on to L.A. Sawr it at 'lerton AMC soon after it came out.",killerofthemoon
"The movie itself is a masterpiece: great acting (not only DiCaprio and DeNiro), great writing (the psychology of the characters is amazing), and very respectful of Indian culture. But the events it depicts are so awful, it makes the movie very tough to watch.",killerofthemoon
"A sensitive and mature exploration of inter racial issues that still exist the USA and elsewhere today. Shot with characteristic Scorsese genius and precision and with brilliant characterisation. The sets and backgrounds all look good and expertly curated. Ocasionally quite difficult to watch because of the subject matter - but this film does make you FEEL. The film falls down on pace - the audience is ahead of the story much of the time - and the length makes for a tiring view. All told - excellent and, above all, important.",killerofthemoon
"Recognizing one's limits is one of the greatest demonstrations of humility a person can give. Evidently this is a lesson that Martin Scorsese struggles to learn despite his venerable age, because his latest and interminable effort fully demonstrates what happens when a director embarks on the making of a movie without knowing how to manage its running time. Killers of the flower moon takes what would basically be a plot full of events, mysteries and food for thought and barely manages to give the latter away, staging various events stacked together in a manner totally devoid of pathos and sense of progression of the narrative. Many facts and things happen but somehow the more the minutes pass the more it seems that nothing has happened. The movie is simply correct, to the extent that: the acting, the direction, the photography and the staging are correct. However, there is not an acting performance, a scene, a line of dialogue or a shot that is memorable and a movie directed by someone of Scorsese's caliber is unthinkable that it is ""simply correct"". Every aspect of the movie is subdued and if this were to be a consequence of his directorial maturation, perhaps Scorsese should have taken refuge in directing a more intimate movie with a less gargantuan duration since he proves to be totally incapable of knowing how to manage it while keeping the audience's attention high from start to finish. Yet in the same year in which this movie was released we had in Oppenheimer a clear example of how the narration of events so distant in time from us can keep us in suspense for 3 hours. The difference between Killers of the flower moon and Oppenheimer, however, lies in the fact that Nolan did not have the same claim as Scorsese to want to teach new generations of spectators what the ""right"" way of making cinema is, without realizing that times are changed and that the way of making movies has changed. Scorsese's career has suffered no more or less the same decline as those comicbook movies that he did so much to denigrate: it began by entertaining crowds of spectators with countless memorable moments and is concluding with a series of products whose only memorability is linked to their anachronism. Because this too, dear Martin, is cinema and you are part of it.",killerofthemoon
"I really enjoyed the film. With that being said, it could have been much better. It is just too long, and there were multiple scenes that drag and that could be cut down or cut all together. There were also moments in which I felt Scorsese was trying to be too clever with his camera movement, when it was completely unnecessary. It was noticeable and the story should always be the focus. But it is a compelling story and it is mind boggling that Leonardo DiCaprio didn't get an Oscar nomination for best actor. Definitely worth seeing, but I don't know if I'd ever want to watch it again.",killerofthemoon
i absolutely loved this movie it's worth the 3 hours i think this movie also has a good representation of indigenous peoples. this movie is one of the best movies.,killerofthemoon
Did they run out of money at the end of the film? The wrapping up of the story in that weird theatre format was just strange. During it I thought that editors and lighting people must be in short supply. It was very badly lit and it rambled on. I did like the Indian cultural references though but cannot see why it got so much hype. Indulgent - could have been good with stringent editing.,killerofthemoon
"Killers of the Flower Moon - 7.3 - Big enough blockbuster of a movie to crack into my reviews. First of all this movie is simply put way too long. The story is interesting and flows well, but three and a half hours at the movie theater is just a lot to ask of any movie. Especially one that is very dialogue heavy and lacking direct like intense action. So going into the movie I knew absolutely nothing about this story, nor had I read the book. The story is very intriguing and keeps you engaged the whole time with how crazy it of a concept it truly is. Leo does he usual At work and delivers an epic performance. Himself and Mollie have a dynamic relationship and it really makes you feel for the story and feel there love for each other to make it so deceiving what was actually going on. It was like a murder mystery of the Osage people, but the point of view was from the point of the murderers. It really did feel at times that Leo did not know he was doing anything wrong. It really felt that he loved his wife, and that he thought he was just helping out his uncle. DeNiro plays his role well in his sinister Oklahoma businessman gangster type role. It is a story showing how greed and power can so easily corrupt people. The cinematography is great, and really immerses you in this rural area in such a wild time in American History. I would not say it is Scorsese's fast ball but it is definitely worth the watch. If this movie was even 1 hour shortly, it would have be night and day better. One thing I did not get as well, how were there not subtitles on some of the long native speaking parts. It felt at times entire conversations happened and we knew nothing what was said. Two Hours perfect, two and a half fine, but three and half is just criminal stuff. Official sundaynightstreaming rating of 7.3",killerofthemoon
"This is a must see for any film lovers out there. DeNiro and DiCaprio are so good as usual and Lilly Gladstone was such a good surprise. This was the first time i watched a movie of hers and she was so magnetic, even without heer character saying much. What a trio of actors! Without getting into spoiler territory, i am glad this movie was made.",killerofthemoon
"Great storytelling by Scorsese and an important part of history to learn more about. Love seeing so many great “character” actors given juicy roles, where as some of the bigger names have smaller (but effective) roles. DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone are great together- she has a stirring presence and the scenes with Leo and De Niro are perfection.",killerofthemoon
"Don't waste your time with this one. It is boring from the first minute and doesn't get better. Hollywood self importance and self indulgence at its finest. Oof, that was a terrible movie.",killerofthemoon
Movie did not feel like it was 3.5 hours long. Incredibly tragic for the Osage people. I do wish they kept the same theme in finishing the movie. The ending was strange but overall the movie did its job in portraying the story of the Osage murders.,killerofthemoon
A wonderfully atmospheric movie with a tragic context. Great acting by the three main characters! A must-see. But the movie is a bit dragged out and gets boring at times.,killerofthemoon
"Well, Gladstone was excellent. Dinero was Dinero and unfortunately DiCaprio is starting to be just like DiCaprio. Love Jesse but again I want to see these guys do something different and interesting.",killerofthemoon
I thought I would have to watch this movie over a couple of days because it's so long. That was not the case at all. It was so interesting and the acting was amazing! I couldn't stop watching it!!!,killerofthemoon
"An amazing yet tragic film. Scorsese finds a way to bring this horrific untold U.S. historical event to life in a well-acted and written film. The cinematography and score are beautiful and can bring you into the film. DiCaprio and De Niro bring their A-game and are fantastic in each of their roles. As good as they were, Lily Gladstone's performance is the heart of the film as she brings the emotion and strength of the film. This is where the problem lies with this film, it should have been told more from her perspective as Scorsese tries to make you sympathetic to Ernest (DiCaprio) when he is doing these evil things. I think the film would have worked better having Molly (Gladstone) in the lead. At the end of the day, it is still a must-see film that you can't miss.",killerofthemoon
"Frankly after loving the book, I was disappointed in the movie. The story and the investigation of the murders was so compelling that I expected more. It is long and plodding it still worth seeing.",killerofthemoon
"Ploddingly slow. Could easily have been 45 minutes shorter without sacrificing any of the story line that was included. Full of Oklahoman and Native American stereotyping. The movie focuses on Leo's character, Ernest Burkhardt. It would have been far more intriguing for the film to focus on De Niro's character, William King Hale.",killerofthemoon
"Was it good? Beats me :/. I made it 30 minutes in and yet again don't care about any of the characters, if they live or die. Write your movies better; with pace and an audience in mind. Edit your movie in case it's overly written and long. If it wasn't Scorsese would anyone have watched this?",killerofthemoon
It was a very. Very. Very. Long movie that I feel didn't need to be that long. The acting and story were good. But I feel like it could've been told an 2 hours instead of almost 4. It was decent enough but I most likely will never watch it again.,killerofthemoon
"""Killers of the Flower Moon"" unfolds an important chapter of history with captivating storytelling. Clocking in at 3 and a half hours, the film's epic scope might test your patience, but it's a narrative that deservedly demands attention. The Osage wealth from oil becomes a sinister backdrop, drawing in a conspiracy of corruption among guardians, judges, lawyers, doctors, and businessmen. While the runtime may feel excessive for a movie, the intricate worldbuilding and classic Scorsese touch make it a visual treat. Lily Gladstone's Oscar-worthy performance as a standout Osage character adds a layer of brilliance, stealing scenes effortlessly. Despite the slow pacing, the evolution into a full-blown mafia drama feels quintessentially Scorsese. De Niro and DiCaprio deliver solid performances, though Gladstone shines brightest. The soundtrack, deserving of its Oscar nomination, complements the immersive experience. The film's second act, albeit a bit sluggish, weaves a captivating narrative. A surprise cameo in the ending adds an extra layer of satisfaction, enhancing the overall impact. While some might argue for a shorter runtime, the engrossing storytelling keeps your eyes glued to the screen. A few casting tweaks could have enhanced the experience, but the film stands tall as a cinematic achievement. Oscars are beckoning, especially for Lily Gladstone, whose exceptional portrayal deserves the spotlight.",killerofthemoon
"If you have 3+ hours to commit, this is a solid watch. I typically can't sit for long movies like this especially when it's an early, 1900's, setting. The character development was solid and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Overall, good watch!",killerofthemoon
"Scorsese is at the height of his powers, and the artistry of DiCaprio and De Niro is on full display, and astonishingly matched by Gladstone. Films like this are an endangered species not to be missed",killerofthemoon
"Way overrated. This movie is too long by at least an hour. More to the point, it provides no particular insights into the Osage killings. It just ploddingly tells the story. Set design is a plus, but it's not nearly enough.",killerofthemoon
"This very long Scorsese period piece is a tale of two halves for me. The first hour and a half or so are full of intrigue with DiCaprio's relationship expanding within the Osage tribe while a conniving Robert Di Niro makes plans to inflitrate them for his own gain. The second half sidelines a lot of the Osage and focuses on the Hales in a sort of courtroom drama swing that I feel was far less interesting than the focus of the first two or so acts. Still, another solid Scorsese historical drama with great performances and constant interesting camerawork.",killerofthemoon
"What makes this movie disturbing is to know its based on history. Caused me to research after watching movie. That and Leo playing a bad person....... I know he doesn't always play the good guy, but this is a new character low. Good cast. Lily Gladstone was excellent & I hope to see her in more movies!!",killerofthemoon
Deniro and Dicaprio are solid. No one else stood out. Mollie character was too sickly to act much. Overrated by most on RT. Way too long. Good plot ruined by too much dead air. A 90 minute run time would have earned more stars.,killerofthemoon
"Thankful for this story to be brought to the screen. One cannot stop to be amazed at how greedy humans can be. Watched it at the movie theater, and unfortunately I had to take a break to pee.",killerofthemoon
An assault on the human senses. it was fantastic up until maybe about an hour and 2030 minutes perhaps but beyond that it just completely dragged it out. there is like barely any dialogue,killerofthemoon
"Great acting. Very impactful story. However, the movie drags and is far too long. If certain unnecessary scenes were cut, this could have been the best movie of the year.",killerofthemoon
"Will go down as one of the definitive American epics of the 21st century. Evil has never felt more grounded, more real, or more close to us as it does here. A masterpiece.",killerofthemoon
"Too long, boring and demoralizing. Poorly dramatized lacking any real friction between opposing forces until near the end. Overall dark and dreary and a low point for Scorsese.",killerofthemoon
"Great book. Great historical non-fiction of a cruel time in Oklahoma. A sad but true tale of human greed. Poor depiction of the people of the days, 1920 post WW1...they took the 1920's and made the characters way too modern..",killerofthemoon
"Really good movie, Jesus is it long. I hate to say it because I am all here for a long movie but it felt like I was watching an extended cut and I could have done with a little more editing and cropping. However the acting is really good, scripts are great and I very much enjoyed engaging with this story. I loved most of the characters…",killerofthemoon
"This artfully scripted and performed movie reveals an unknown darkside of American history. Performances by Lily Gladstone added an authenticity that swept me into the time and its events. DiCaprio was also flawless. If you are looking for light entertainment, this movie is not for you. If you are looking for a masterpiece that will stand the test of time, educate and elevate your perception. Go for it you won't regret it.",killerofthemoon
"It only loses half a star due the extended running time of the film. We watched it over two nights, which I wasn't sure was going to work but it really did. It really does deserve all the hype, Lily Gladstone is so captivating. I am sad Leo didn't get an Oscar nod for this but happy Robert de Niro is being recognised for his amazing performance.",killerofthemoon
"DiCaprio's performance is ""Oscar worthy"" The movie is long but needs to be in order to tell the whole story. Worth the 3 1/2 hours.",killerofthemoon
"Good movie (acting, directing, etc.), but... With good movies, I often feel they should be longer to tell more of the story. With KoFM, it felt like they went 1.5 hours too ling to tell a simple story.",killerofthemoon
"""Killer of an Afternoon"" is more like it. The movie is okay but easily 1.5 hours too long and several accents seemed off… not sure what they were going for. A documentary would have been better.",killerofthemoon
"An extraordinarily powerful and emotional examination of greed, corruption and exploitation, well outside Scorsese's familiar New York stamping ground, but dealing with themes common to all his films. It is stunningly well designed and photographed, and features great performances from DiCaprio, De Niro, newcomer Gladstone and Jesse Plemons. It is very long and might be best enjoyed in chunks. Astonishing that Scorsese could produce such fine work at his age.",killerofthemoon
I don't understand the good reviews. It looked to me like people acting in a film on a set. Not authentic. Contrived. I only lasted 45 minutes. This was not De Niro's best work.,killerofthemoon
"Yes, it's a long movie. Very long. It's also rather slow in many areas. I've split it up across 3 evenings. That being said, it's not a Marvel et al movie, and makes no pretense of being so. The setting and story line require a slow pace. I'm pleased with how it's turned out so far. Am watching the last half this weekend. Definitely worth the watch, just approach it as more than the usual weekend entertainment film and you'll be okay.",killerofthemoon
It was a little too long for a movie in which there's little suspense. That doesn't mean it wasn't well done and well acted. And I'm giving it an extra half star for having Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson in it.,killerofthemoon
What is so great about a way too long movie centered around dimwitted Ernest? I also don't see how Lilly Gladstone won any awards... her emotional makeup was about as flat as a pancake. It's quite unfortunate that what was a horrific episode in our history ended up as such a snoozefest.,killerofthemoon
"Killers of the Flower Moon is a brutal watch that makes you pay for all the beauty in it. Like watching a historic boxing match where both the fighters a destroyed and bleeding, but all long putting on one hell of a show. It was absolutely worth the wait and hype. The set design is flawless and Lily Gladstone's gift stands out amongst some of the best actors in Hollywood. A must see!",killerofthemoon
"Look, it's a good watch definitely and it doesn't drag, which is impressive in 3.5 days of film (sorry, hours). So why only 3 stars? Well the story is nothing special as you know what's going to happen, what things are going to come to a head. Sure, it builds well but there are no twists, nothing unexpected, it's all pretty linear. Good but you'll never need to watch again.",killerofthemoon
"An epic for the ages. Great historical drama based on true events. Impressive acting by its heavyweight stars, and relative newcomers alike. Scorsese hits it out of the park once again.",killerofthemoon
Was an hour to long. The film was one of the worst by the director and worst I have scene in a long time and I see a lot. Leonardo Caprio acting was bad this time. Best to watch on a steaming service than paying full ticket price.,killerofthemoon
A gorgeous cinematic experience with a gut wrenching story ultimately betrayed by the ego of Director Martin Scorsese and his inability to contain his vision into a reasonable running length. Unbearably long.,killerofthemoon
Es una peli muy divertida me encanto la trama y la comedia que se maneja es muy interesante por qué te traslada a emociones muy diversas,killerofthemoon
"The beginning dragged, and then the ended went way too fast. Like someone just stood up, clapped his hands, and said ""alright does this up guys!"" Didn't bond or care about any of the characters. I really wanted to like this, but just didn't.",killerofthemoon
"It was a good movie and it should have been made about the topic, but it could have been a lot shorter. It dragged along.",killerofthemoon
"This is the third Scorsese film I gave 4.5 stars to. Maybe he is becoming my favorite director of all-time, and I haven't even seen his top five on Letterboxd. With Killers, he remains standing strong and tall as a competitive director at his age and in this day and age. The one bad thing I had read and heard about Killers was its runtime. It's true; I had to watch it for two days, but is it a bad thing for me? No. Watching it didn't feel like a chore. That is only possible if it's a gripping story with an even more gripping storytelling and has an equally talented cast. DiCaprio was no surprise, Gladstone rightfully earned all the Best Actress nods for her understated performance and bold presence in all scenes she was in (I have yet to see Poor Things for my final Best Actress pick), and we need more De Niro-Scorsese tandem because they just work so well together. I loved Killers for its important and enlightening narrative and how it was made for the audience to enjoy but also to be educated. It is a history Western but didn't waterboard me with breaths from panting so thirstily for awards. Learn it the hard way, the Scorsese way.",killerofthemoon
"I hated this. Felt like 3 hours of Native American torture porn. Definitely needed edited down as it spent 3/4 of the film repeating the same plot points. Besides the Scorsese name and Lily’s performance, I don’t see why this film is as highly rated as it is.",killerofthemoon
"By many directors few have a reputation as big as Martins Scorsese, from his start with Raging Bull, to his success of Goodfellas the director has certainly influenced cinema, as a consequence his latest release Killers of the Flower Moon left many wondering if it was able to stand proudly with his others movies and be remembered as another masterpiece or it would end up a massive disappointment. The movie starts with ww2 vet Ernest coming to an native part of America, he quickly marries a rich girl named Molly that is an heir for many lands with lots of oil in them and so to have the full inheritance Ernest and his uncle William slowly but brutally kill all of Molly sisters while Ernest struggles with the morality of his actions. It certainly is an emotional movie with its main strengths being their two main characters , Ernest remains a routable yet hateable protagonist quickly and effectively making you hate and love him, Molly also is a highlight in this movie giving silent but heartbreaking scenes furthermore the supporting cast of characters are all very entertaining, however the movie suffers for a 3-hour runtime making it feel sometime too slow for it own right. In conclusion Killers of the flower moon is a beautiful and heartbreaking movie, but it can only be fully appreciated for its 3 hours runtime",killerofthemoon
The movie back drop and costumes were great. The acting was kinda weird and it was way too long and progressed too slowly. Could have cut out an hour and lost no content.,killerofthemoon
"Such an incredible cast and beautiful film overall. I'm in such awe of everyone's performances, especially Lily Gladstone. The film didn't shy away from the gruesome truth about the Osage's murders, but still told it with grace.",killerofthemoon
"This film required 3 sittings to watch. It was good, informative, well directed, but would have been nothing without Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro. The story was one worth telling, but nothing stood out. The actors were okay, the cast was okay, the story was okay, the filmography was okay. It was all okay. Leo and De Niro, as always, killed it as actors. They managed to depict the personalities of real individuals who were greedy, but also honest and confused. They carried the entire film and the rest of the cast kind of just revolved around them. I can't say it's a must watch, but if you want to see a couple of masters practicing their craft, this is one way to do it.",killerofthemoon
"Overall, this is a decent adaptation of David Grann's book. However, the historical truths get overshadowed by bombastic performances and cinematography. I would have preferred more editing and focus on the Osage experiences. Still, important to watch! 3.5 stars",killerofthemoon
It did a disservice to the story. Considering the people involved I think whoever wrote the screenplay should have spent more time or the director. Considering the people involved it is very disappointing.,killerofthemoon
"As others have said its 3.5 hour runtime is arduous and I'm glad I watched it at home and not in a cinema. It's a long time to watch such a dark and depressing tale entirely devoid of heros or 'good guys'. Nonetheless, it is well made with standout acting performances from Lily Gladstone and Robert De Niro. I think my big criticism is it's predictability. There are no shocks or twists in this story and you understand fairly early on what is happening. Even the multiple murders lack any suspense and are handled so casually. That was obviously a stylistic choice (perhaps out of respect for the victims) but it doesn't make for the most engaging watch. A solid 3 and half stars.",killerofthemoon
If you can't sit through 3 and a half hours break up the movie into 2 parts which is what I did. Other than that it just felt so surreal watching the movie. The plot had my jaw to the floor at times. I have not read the book but I heard the book was also incredible.,killerofthemoon
"esta pelicula centra mucho nuestra atencion ya que invoca diferentes estilos de emocion y sentimientos encontrados a nuestra realidad , los invito a verla , espectacular .",killerofthemoon
"I must be in the minority that thinks that this admittedly well-acted movie was excruciatingly, painfully slow paced. Would've been more powerful & made it's point with more emotional impact at 2 hrs. But 3:15?? torture!",killerofthemoon
"I did like the story and bringing this history to the forefront. I thought it was going to be the Osage at the forefront, the main focus was being told by Leo's character and not Lily's character. It was more focused on him. My only gripe but overall a great movie.",killerofthemoon
"I was so looking forward to this movie, and boy am I glad I did not waste money watching it in a theater. Simply put, it was a hot mess. Scorsese's cameo at the end was laughable. The story, so important in our history was turned into something oddly and (assumingly) unintentionally comical and nonsensical. The acting was flat, and frankly the characters came off as bland and droll. If the intent was for the audience to feel their pain and suffering, that was certainly lost. The three-plus gruelling hours were an indictment on the narcissism that infests the entertainment industry.",killerofthemoon
"Para Martin Scorsese, el mal de los hombres es un monstruo devorador. Algo que explora en profundidad en Killers of the Flower Moon, su película más ambiciosa. [Reseña completa en español]",killerofthemoon
"Overlong? Absolutely, but the shere scale and production of this film is a must see. DiCaprio as ever is phenomenal, and everyone else involved take to the task and deliver award worthy performances accross the board. My issue, like most I can imagine, is the this current trend of making a story that could be told in 2hrs go on for nearly 4, it out stayed its welcome and then some. If this film was made into a 6 part mini series I would probably be saying different, but the thought of sitting in a packed cinema to watch this film gives me buckets of anxiety, thankfully I watched at home and split into 2 parts. Its scorsese so the detail is typically fantastic, based on the novel which I half read during lockdown, this film is true to the source and for those unaware of the story of the Osage, can learn alot from viewing this oscar baiting epic, will I watch again....maybe",killerofthemoon
"Stunning powerful story and important history of our indigenous neighbors and ourselves, respectfully made with powerful acting, and well worthwhile. Kept hoping for redemption, but dominated by selfish brutality and hard to watch so many bad choices.",killerofthemoon
"Hideously slow and overly looooong. The performances were fine (although a waste of top talent) and the production values are top-notch, but when you start checking your watch every few minutes halfway through the film, that's not a good sign. A masterpiece? I think not.",killerofthemoon
"Am I rating how good of a film I think it is or how much I enjoyed it? I'm going with the latter and giving it a 3 -- I don't give half stars or else this might have landed at 3.5 -- otherwise if I was going with the former approach I would probably give it 4 stars on merit alone. I just can't really say I enjoyed 3+ hours of this story. Scorsese is so all over the place for me. Sometimes I love his work, other times it's meh or bleh, but it's never ""wow that was not good"". And this one was somewhere in the middle. Probably a great film by all ""film school"" sorts of accounts, but just very fine for me.",killerofthemoon
"This movie is amazing, the story is shocking (especially because it's true story), the movie is beautiful, the acting is outstanding (especially Lily Gladstone). All in all I have two problems with the movie: this is a 2h30m movie packed in 3:30m and being so long it still manages to feel that the ending is rushed. So that is why I can't go with 5 stars only with 4.5",killerofthemoon
"I absolutely loved it. It's not going to make you feel good, but it's gripping storytelling that's so masterfully done. The 1-stars on here make absolutely no sense to me. Only thing I can think of is that people are expecting an action-thriller type movie going in. There is no action. If that's what you're looking for this movie is not for you. I'm so in awe of the skills Martin Scorsese still possess and he is definitely the greatest director of all time.",killerofthemoon
"So disappointing! I watched a docudrama about these murders and the creation of the FBI a while ago and it was more gripping, interesting and important than this dreary overlong film. I felt it should have been told from the perspective of Molly and her family rather than the 2 main protagonists. I thought DiCaprio and De Niro were both miscast and wasted on this movie. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!",killerofthemoon
"I liked it. Teaches you some history while being entertaining. Still, it is long and you do feel that. Some great acting from lily gladstone just takes this up a notch though Would recommend to ""movie people"" looking for something different to watch",killerofthemoon
The story is compelling and needed to be told. But it was so long and somewhat redundant that it lost some of its punch particularly on how the FBI made its case etc. 30-45 mins less and may have given it a 4. Do Caprio seemed miscast.,killerofthemoon
"Absolutely superb rendition of a true story about the Osage nation! Brilliant performances by Leonardo di Caprio, Lucy Gladstone and Robert De Niro - definitely the best picture of 2023!",killerofthemoon
Loved it! I didn't know what to expect one into this movie but I walked out overwhelmed. It was really awesome. I'm glad I watched it.,killerofthemoon
"Martin Scorsese has missed again. Putting Leonardo DiCaprio as a young handsome man back from the War, was laughable. If you need to snooze for 3 1/2 hours , watch this. It is slow, slower, slowest",killerofthemoon
"The film wouldn't be bad even if it was too long for me but the question is: Is it possible that Scorsese has no other actors than the usual DiCaprio? Leaving aside De Niro who is now the default Among other things, his part could easily have been done by someone else... and perhaps better",killerofthemoon
"Really long. DeNiro and DiCaprio feel way too old for their roles and despite doing a good job they don't feel quite right for the roles. Movie is well crafted and scenes are interesting but after watching it there's no way it needed to be 3.5 hours. It's an important story to tell, but that doesn't mean it is a movie worth devoting that much time to, for me at least. Wish the movie felt bigger, it seemed like 3.5 hours of tight shots and conversations about killing people or conning people. Would've liked to see more of the world, wider shots, more of the Osage and how they lived instead of just a few conversations they had about the killings.",killerofthemoon
"Besides the movie being a little too long, the film was well executed. Liked how Martin Scorsese was able to implement a full setting to try to represent the time that Osage people existed. Robert Deniro and Leonardo Dicaprio had an unbreakable chemistry, with Deniro showing his act without having to overdo it. Lily Gladstone was a highlight in that I felt she was able to take us through the story of how her family shrank one by one, followed by the representation of discrimination and the evil part of humanity. I liked the usage of the supporting cast because the uniqueness was essential for each part of the story.",killerofthemoon
"This one was definitely worth seeing. I would venture a guess that if it didn't have DeNiro, DiCaprio and Scorsese's names attached to it, it wouldn't have have been so critically acclaimed. You could have easily trimmed 45 minutes off of it without missing much.",killerofthemoon
"I can't believe I let movie awards hype trick me into watching another slow, dark, and disconnected flick. Really disappointed. Where's the character development? Not a single scene expressing Leo's relationship with his children, then we're supposed to believe he's all torn up by his daughter's death?",killerofthemoon
"What a SLOG. The arrogance of Scorsese to put forth this 3.5 hour film is mind boggling. The way in which the length undermines Mollie's story is criminal. I don't care about Leonardo DiCaprio's stupid character. He is way too much of the focus of the movie. All of the hype surrounding the Osage finally getting their story told by an influential ally in Scorsese is laughable. This isn't their story. It's Ernest Burkhart's dumb story. Just market it as such, or else take out at least an hour so that Mollie can be the focus. I'm giving it two stars because the acting is very good and the cinematography is beautiful.",killerofthemoon
"There's two evenings I'll never get back! 94% critics and 84% viewers!? Is there two films and I've watched the wrong one? ""King and his clothes"" The plot was I obvious and could have been adequately conveyed in half the time. With exception to a couple of scenes the acting was one dimensional with RD just going through the motions. There must a number of middle aged actors that could have done a more convincing job. Far too many people getting swayed by a couple of big names.",killerofthemoon
Score was decent. Accents and acting were drab. Another one of those movies where all the best bits are in the preview. Nothing else of merit. 3+ hrs of waiting around knowing what was going to happen next. No surprises. Yawn. No action. Lame dialogue. It feels as though this movie was made for idiots. Wish I had spent that time doing anything else. Booo!,killerofthemoon
"Don't let the 3 and a half hour runtime stop you from watching it. This movie is so good with some of the best acting you'll ever see, arguably Scorsese's best work with an emotional and sad story about the Osage.",killerofthemoon
Very compelling and moving storyline of Indigenous Peoples and their adversity of a hidden historical account of the Osage Peoples. DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone did amazing job in depicting this storyline and account of a true-American history of a family undergone tremendous misfortune at the hands of greedy oil workers.,killerofthemoon
"It's that time of year again, when we reflect back on the best of last year's movies. Like clockwork, names that are sure to be part of that list are Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Leonardo Dicaprio. Oh and hey, wouldn't you know it, Killers of the Flower Moon has all three. So, naturally critics immediately start throwing around words like ""masterpiece"" or ""perfection, "" but does the movie live up to the hype? In a word, no. For starters, this movie is long, I mean REALLY long. While I wouldn't have an issue with the length, if well-paced, this movie was painfully slow. What's worse is I can tell which moments needed to be shaved off. For instance, when I watch a movie, I ask myself, ""why did the director want me to see this shot?"" Sometimes this can be obvious. When they linger on a specific character or object it could be meant as a piece of foreshadowing, predicting events to come. In this case, however, there were so many unnecessary scenes to the plot, that ultimately slowed the pacing to a crawl. Next, is frankly one of my biggest historical movie faux pas. Watch any older video of the time and you'll find the streets, bars or restaurants vacant, 50-100 people tops, even during the busiest of times. Yet, for some reason, certain directors insist on packing scenes full of people, or activities, to visually stimulate the audience. They'll call it authenticity but I call it ""visual noise"" and disingenuous. Lastly, some directors prefer a bare scripts to allow their actors the freedom to ad-lib. This is designed to create a natural, authentic (there's that word again) interactions between actors. Unfortunately, without the proper guidance this can lead to uncomfortable and awkward performances. In this case, I feel the better performances were from some the supporting cast rather than the principles.",killerofthemoon
"Brilliant performances. Beautiful, sweeping cinematography. An incredibly compelling and engaging story. Do not let the long runtime scare you - every minute is worth it.",killerofthemoon
"Martin Scorsese's latest epic is long enough, but is it truly strong enough to make the guilty parties of our whitewashing society culpable? My thought is no, it's not. It's good to know that there is awareness, but it's not changing our culture. The elitist entitled class is still just that, no less burdened by anything their own forefathers might have done -- or not done in the form of remaining quiet. Scorsese hits a target, but it's not the target. De Niro is as good as ever and DiCaprio pales beneath all of them with a shoddy performance that falls well beneath those of De Niro and Lily Gladstone. Still, it's a very good film and, most importantly, an important one to know and tell.",killerofthemoon
"Worst, most boring film in a long time… turned it off after an hour when I realized it had 2.5 hours more to go. The time frame jumped right over any pregnancies and births!! Imagine, you have 3 and a half hours to tell a story and you can't even multiple children joining the fold. Totally the emperors new cloths in my world",killerofthemoon
"This is indeed a story that needs to be told but what a massive pile of poop!! This is a case of the Emperor has no clothes! Come on people, be honest and objective, this movie did not have more than three hours of content. The filmmaking was bad, the editing was bad, the acting was HORRIBLE, the script was bad and there were so many unanswered questions and random scenes, that I just wanted to stab myself in the eye from the boredom and frustration. I so looked forward to seeing this movie and it turned out to be the biggest disappointment of this century to date.",killerofthemoon
"I was waiting excitedly to watch this movie. Even though the movie tells us the sad history of our country. However, the story did not flow as good as I was hoping for. Somehow the movie was less that what I was expecting.",killerofthemoon
"I think Leo's glory days are OVER. I grew up a huge fan of his, ever since Growing Pains. However Leo has become so fat and disgusting, not to mention how we all learned his 25yr old or younger policy, this movie made me want to vomit bc of what I know about him. Leo can't lead a cast anymore.",killerofthemoon
"Loved it. Way, way too long running time. They should have made it a series and it wouldn't have taken me 3 days to watch☹️ Wonderful acting and such sad true story",killerofthemoon
"Martin Scorcese is legendary and he's still at the top of his game. Essentially what this movie is about is oil is found on Osage land and one by one all of the native Americans are murdered for their money, This was everything I expected it would be like and nothing like I expected it would be like all wrapped in one. I think Robert DeNiro actually gives a really good performance. I haven't been so impressed with him as of late so it was good to see him act the way I know he's capable of. Leo has some weird acting choices and accents in it that I didn't really like. I don't know of too many movies where I'm iffy on an acting performance by Leo- and while I respect him for taking a chance- I didn't really think it worked Lily Gladstone really steals the show in this one though. Leo and Robert are big personalities; however, she doesn't simply blend in with them. She commands the screen. This film topped most of the areas I look for when giving a review. The only knock on this film is I don't know it has the value of a rewatch. If you've seen it once, I don't think you'll be going too much out of your way to keep rewatching it. 9.3",killerofthemoon
Acting and everything about it first rate- but the material was a little dense and the movie so long that I can't really in good conscience recommend it.,killerofthemoon
This movie feels like homework. It is not good. I got 49 min into it and I literally don't know what the point is. I have watched slugs crawl that are more interesting.,killerofthemoon
"Can we please stop pretending that these absurdly long and incredibly boring movies are some sort of cinematic masterpieces simply because they were made by relics of the past? This has got to be one of the most boring movies that I’ve ever watched. Somewhere in this half-day long movie, someone’s house blows up. I had the volume up kinda loud and I thought, “Man, I wish that were my house right now.” Maybe that’s how this movie is getting all of the attention it so richly doesn’t deserve. All of those mob movies. Maybe everyone is afraid to tell Scorsese that his movies kinda suck because they’re afraid that the mob will pay them a visit if they do.",killerofthemoon
"Snooze fest. The story should've been told from the FBI investigators' perspectives, not the deplorable villains which erased all mystery and suspense. Book was great.",killerofthemoon
"An amazing story that has escaped our history. A little slow at times but the acting and the work of Mr. Scorsese is amazing. The film left me both amazed and sad. Leonardo D'Caprio is engaging in his role as a moronic nephew to Di Nero's conniving character ""King"". The entire cast is amazing. Definitely worth the 3 1/2 hours.",killerofthemoon
"Simply put, not an entertaining movie in my eyes. The editing felt really off and the length of the movie was unnecessary. Lily Gladstone's acting was the one bright spot.",killerofthemoon
"DiCaprio once again proves that he is one of the worst actors in Hollywood! The movie was way too long and at least half of it should have been left on the cutting room floor. And, finally, the is straight up stupid.",killerofthemoon
"One of the best movies of 2023, with superb acting from DeNiro and DiCaprio. Wow! (Paid $19.99 to rent and it was worth it) Well written script, fascinating, and the fact it was so long did not bother me at all, I could have watched another hour, it was astonishing in that fact it is based on real events. All fo the characters were intriguing and the plot was shocking and good.",killerofthemoon
"Finally got a chance to check it out today. (Hey, when you're snowed in, bring on the 3 hour 26 minute Scorsese movie!) It was... pretty good. Not great, but pretty good. First of all, it's definitely a Scorsese movie. The visuals and technique are of course awesome, which is not surprising at all. The score by Robbie Robertson (RIP) is great... at turns menacing and wistful when it needs to be. And a lot of the performances are great. (DeNiro maybe doesn't nail the accent, but it's still a good ""banality of evil"" performance by him.) I can't really slag DiCaprio anymore, because he's really good in this film. Good supporting performances surround those two. Lily Gladstone definitely needs some award consideration as well for her performance. However... from a screenwriting perspective, I think there's some problems. I haven't read the book yet (I have it in my possession to do so), but I'm betting it's going to be a different perspective than what you see here. I certainly don't think it was an intention of Roth and Scorsese to make the people who were the SUBJECT of the atrocities peripheral to their own story, but unfortunately that's what you kind of get here, despite the director making some valiant attempts to circumvent that. Look, we get it: if your film stars Leo, then the focus is going to be on him, whether it should be or not, but that's the main quibble I have with the film. Small quibble is the length. Yes, yes, ""saving cinema"" and all that, thanks Marty, but ""Goodfellas"" is 2 1/2 hours and is, in my opinion, better than this movie. I'm still recommending it, but as I said, I get a feeling that when I'm finished with the book, I'm definitely going to be in the camp that feels the book is much better than the movie. Which is usually the case, I know, but I'm just curious to see what another director with, shall we say, a different perspective, might have brought to the film. With no disrespect to Mr. S, because I remain a big fan. This is just one of his ""very good"" efforts and not one of his masterpieces, in my opinion.",killerofthemoon
"What on earth are the bad reviews about?! Yes it's a long film, and I wish I'd stocked up on popcorn, but boring?!!! What on earth??! It's a story of greed, and the story is grim. But the movie's a masterpiece!",killerofthemoon
"Putting aside how relentlessly grim the story is, there's an inevitably to the unfolding of events that saps the film of suspense and narrative tension. At three hours, it's a marathon of murder that hardly feels worth the time, except as an overdue admission of guilt.",killerofthemoon
"Seemed like it could have been shorter. Story was filled with repetition, and dragged. This isn't even a top ten 10 Scorsese movie. It felt like a premium TV show not a movie.",killerofthemoon
"First, the good: Lily Gladstone. She deserves any accolades she will get for this film. Now the rest... What could have/should have been a compelling tale of greed and murder became an overly long exercise in directorial ego. This movie is what happens when no one wants to tell a legendary director that they should let an editor take a crack at the film before releasing the director's cut. An interesting story could have been about the Osage and the agents who tracked down the killers. Instead we get a overly long, muddled focus on the criminals. A focus on King and Ernest might have been okay if (1) we had gotten more of a backstory about the criminals (how did King come to be King?, was Ernest always as dumb as he was during the period covered by the film?) or (2) more exploration of the killings and how people in the community reacted to them (more detail on the impact in the community, who did they suspect was responsible?). It's amazing that in 3.5 hours, so many potentially interesting parts of the story were not told. Instead we get vignettes and glimpses which take the place of exposition. Perhaps tell us more about the KKK than a few seconds of them marching in a parade? How about a bit more detail on the relationship of the Osage killing to the Tulsa massacre? A lot of the press has lauded Scorsese for using Native American actors and Osage dialog. This is commendable, but at this point shouldn't that be taken for granted? Is it really so remarkable that a big budget file would do the right thing? And finally, what's with the radio play at the end? So many interesting pieces of the story are jammed into a jarring conclusion that seemed as though even the director knew this had gone on too long but he needed to tie up loose ends. Many films will end with a list the crimes and sentences in a series of scrolls but Scorsese decides to use a radio play as the delivery mechanism. An interesting look into Foley artists and radio play production to be sure, but is that what was important about the wrapup? The significance of the aftermath of the killings took a back seat to the vanity project of showing how radio plays were created. I had hope for this movie despite it's length. Given the critical acclaim, I figured Scorsese had made an important contribution to our understanding of this suppressed period of our history. I was wrong.",killerofthemoon
Over acted. Horribly long and annoying pointless scenes. 3.5 hours of my life i will never get back. I surprisingly stuck with it but make no mistake this is a very mediocre movie at best.,killerofthemoon
Film 101 teaches that you must edit your scenes to keep the plot moving forward and to avoid losing your audience. Scorcesee is self indulgent & selfish to put viewers through what felt like an uncut version of just an okay movie. Knock an hour off and it would have been more palatable. What I find truly silly is that this film is nominated for so many awards and has a 93% on rotten tomatoes by critics. Highlighting the ridiculousness of the Hollywood inner circle and the inability for those to potentially pan such a highly regarded director.,killerofthemoon
"Through the roof production value, except for an edit which appears to be non-existent, fails to carry over-indulgence on a grand scale. Scorsese has done some great stuff but it was all a long time ago. Age is, more often than not, a talent killer and Scorsese is no exception. Hang up your boots old man while you still have some dignity.",killerofthemoon
"Na década de 20, no século passado, a nação indígena Osage encontra petróleo nas terras da sua reserva, tornando-os milionários. Porém, uma série de mortes e assassinatos começam a acontecer entre eles. Isto é o pano de fundo para a história de Ernest e Molly Burkhart. Ele, um soldado retornando da Primeira Guerra, buscando fortuna. Ela, uma osage rica com o dinheiro do petróleo. Vendo esse filme, logo uma coisa aflora: para certas pessoas, é inconcebível que pessoas não brancas possam ter dinheiro. Fico pensando que os osages talvez achassem que eles seriam aceitos na sociedade dos brancos com o dinheiro do petróleo, mas isso apenas despertou o pior em muitos brancos. O dinheiro dos osages causou uma inversão: os empregados agora eram os brancos. O quanto isso deve ter pirado os preconceituosos! É nesse caldeirão que Ernest chega para ganhar dinheiro, trabalhando para seu tio. E o primeiro diálogo entre Ernest e o seu tio já demonstra todo o mau-caratismo de William Hale. Complementando, temos Molly Brown. Enquanto Ernest é falador, Hale, uma serpente sempre armando e pronta para dar o bote, Molly observa a tudo. Ela percebe as intenções de Ernest quando ele começa a cortejá-la. Ela tenta ser um apoio para a sua família, começando a ser destroçada, com os casamentos com homens brancos. E Molly tem a serenidade e a austeridade que os seus algozes brancos não têm. E que trio espetacular! Di Caprio, De Niro e Lily Gladstone fornecem interpretações magistrais, que merecem todos os prêmios e indicações que receberam. E Scorsese dá um show de direção, com um roteiro redondo e preciso, uma montagem excepcional, que não permite que o filme torne-se cansativo com suas mais de 3 horas de duração, figurino excelente, direção de arte apuradíssima, uma aula de cinema. E o filme assume várias identidades. É um western a la corrida do ouro. É um filme de gangster, onde o silêncio a todos protege. É um filme policial, investigativo, com os integrantes do iniciante Bureau de Investigação tentando resolver o caso e prender os culpados. É uma denúncia de uma parte da história norte-americana que estava sendo apagada dos livros. E é uma fábula sobre ganância, preconceito, inveja, como somente o cinema e Scorsese podem produzir.",killerofthemoon
"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” is an underwhelming continuation without a star but also without nuance that is or a messy holding place til the next installment in the MCU. Ryan Coogler clearly rushed this story after they lost their lead actor but it ultimately causes an unfinished poor quality to this changed story. Let’s face it, the first “Black Panther"" despite being a very average Marvel film was a cultural phenomenon. It was largely over praised by the critics with better reviews than made over $700 million in the US, and was the first comic book movie nominated for an Oscar for Best Picture. It was a significant film but not a memorable film. Disney has pumped up the Marvel fan base like crazy. But I think they, like the regular audience I saw “WF” with this afternoon, will be disappointed. The opening act is all about losing and mourning T’Challa, which director Ryan Coogler milks for everything he’s got. They’ve even turned the opening Marvel logo sequence into its own memorial montage. And then there’s the majestic funeral. The only thing they’re missing is lox and bagels at the shivah. Then, however, you have to have a movie — and they don’t. The world is mad at Wakanda for not sharing its vibranium, the magic material in the water under the powerful island country. Even the UN is mad the Wakandans won’t share it with them. (There’s a UN in the Marvel universe? For what purpose?) Eventually enemies arrive to try and dig the stuff up. Tenoch Huerta plays Namor, the leader of the pack, dressed as a gladiator from a 1950s epic. He is no Thanos (Josh Brolin) the really upsetting villain from the Avengers movies. Forget the hype. Namor is silly. There’s never a suggestion he’s going to win. You could almost call this movie “The Woman King,” but that title obviously is unavailable. But with T’Challa gone, he’s briefly succeeded by his mother, the always sensational Angela Bassett. Bassett is a STAR. Unfortunately, her Queen Ramonda exits the movie at the halfway point with not much character development. Letitia Wright’s Shuri becomes the Black Panther, but does not fill the void. The two remaining women — Lupita Nyong’o and Danai Gurira — are top notch but they also are written as supporting players. (Also, once Ramonda has left, Shuri doesn’t seem to miss her much.) Well, nature abhors a vacuum. And that’s what the second act is, even with cameo appearances by Julia Louis Dreyfus and Martin Freeman as rogue CIA agents. Winston Duke as M’Baku flits in and out but isn’t much of a presence. So when this two hour forty one minute extravaganza rolls to a somber ending, the audience just sits there hoping for something to chew on. Eventually they get it: a post credits Marvel when the gorgeous Nakia (the very underused Nyong’o) reveals she had a child with T’Challa who she’s been hiding in Haiti. He will be the Black Panther of the third and final movie. Yes, the audience applauded. I groaned however because that's the worst predictable storytelling soap opera like trope you could use, T'Challa doesn't need a biological son to make this transition to continue the character's legacy. If Boseman had lived, who knows what a sequel would have been like? He really projected heroism and nobility. He was the center of “Black Panther,” you couldn’t take your eyes off of him. Unfortunately, “Wakanda Forever” is a movie with a hole at its center. Boseman’s T’Challa is gone, and the movie doesn’t know how to get around that problem. T’Challa didn’t have a brother or son to replace or succeed him. The original film was already heavily stacked with powerful females, and they are all back. But without Boseman, there’s no movie star, no anchor to continue the story.",blackpanthere
"Establishing the villain early helped, unlike some other post-Endgame MCU films. It was an admirable effort to try and overcome the challenge the film faced, but it got to a point where it needed a lead. It was honestly a good subplot though, waiting to see who the next Black Panther will be, and as such it was a good impromptu origin story of sorts. Again, the fake languages and subtitles were too frequent and jarring, as was another nearly three-hour runtime for a non-finale MCU movie.",blackpanthere
"The plot makes no sense. I despise how they removed T'Challa? Unless it was some super virus that was sweeping the country that some super villain made then he should not have died. If it was a super virus sweeping the country then we should have seen them fighting for the people and trying to stop it with some cure coming in short order. That was a total cheese maneuver to just have him die in the very beginning. Did you ever tell cooperative stories when you were younger? Then you have one person who decides they don't like where the story is headed and say ""then you wake up"" just so they could change the storyline? That's what this was. For some reason, someone did not want T'Challa to be king so they whacked him in the dumbest way possible. Then there is M'Baku. M'Baku challenged T'Challa for the kingship previously, there is no reason to expect that the day he died M'Baku would not challenge for it again. With no king to defend the throne it would have gone to him. So, M'Baku should have been king throughout the movie. The rest of it could have generally taken place the same way but the focus should not have been on the queen. She would have just been a grieving queen mother and then a worried mother for Shuri. I'm a bit of purist when it comes to the comics so I prefer to keep the movies somewhat grounded in the comics. Namor is Atlantean, not Mayan. Even if we run with the Mayan idea, how did they develop their tech which seems to be ahead of the surface world in many ways (the mini-rebreather for instance)? They were not in a position to share ideas with other nations so most likely their society would have stagnated, not progressed in tech. And the depiction of the poor Mayan's dying from the Spaniards invasion. If we are going to depict the dark side of one culture we should include the dark side of the other. In order to get their deity to give them a sign the Mayan's likely sacrificed someone if not multiple people, likely children. The Mayan culture, just like the Aztec culture, was brutal and evil. I just can't stand cultural whitewashing to make one group look bad over the other. I lost interest in it and didn't finish. The action was decent, the siren idea was cool but again they should have been Atlanteans affiliated with the med and not the Mayans. I wish they hadn't killed off T'Challa and that they would have made the background and developing plot tie together better.",blackpanthere
"Given an impossible task, this film made a future for the Black Panther. Bookending the movie with funerals for the Black Panther, the leader, and T'Challa, the brother, was a great decision.",blackpanthere
"What I am sure was one of the most difficult films to make without Chadwick Boseman, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever tackles his in-universe passing, the introduction of a new nation, and the rise of a new Black Panther with grace—even if not every element are executed perfectly. Let’s start with the weaker aspects. The visuals are noticeably flatter than the first film, with more noticeable green screen use and sequences that are overly dark—especially underwater or nighttime scenes—making action hard to follow both in theaters and at home. While I loved the introduction of Namor and the Mayan-inspired nation, we spend surprisingly little time with this world beyond Namor himself, leaving it underdeveloped. Where the film shines is in its emotional balance and performances. The mix of grief, humor, and action feels more cohesive than in many recent MCU films. The action remains engaging and varied, from Riri’s aerial flight sequences to intense underwater combat. Tenoch Huerta’s Namor is a standout, embodying terror, anger, and compassion all at once. Angela Bassett also delivers one of the franchise’s best performances, channeling strength, grief, and authority with genuine power. While the film is not bad by any means, it doesn’t quite reach the heights of the original, Wakanda Forever is still a worthy successor—anchored by its emotional core, strong performances, and respectful handling of an impossible loss.",blackpanthere

"Black Panther 2 was an amazing sequel that honored Chadwick Boseman’s legacy while pushing the story forward in powerful ways.

"Very original and over just beautiful movie with great music, scenery, and characters. The plot was very unique compared to a lot of the marvel movie plots. Great tribute to Chadwick!",blackpanthere
"The film explores grief, strength, and leadership as Wakanda faces new global threats after King T’Challa’s death. Shuri, Queen Ramonda, and other key characters take the spotlight, navigating deep emotional arcs and epic battles especially against the underwater kingdom of Talokan and its leader, Namor. With stunning visuals, a rich soundtrack, and strong performances, it’s both a heartfelt farewell and a thrilling superhero story that honors the past while shaping the future.",blackpanthere
"I liked the pace of the story line in the first movie better. But definitely a good movie still, I feel like marvel did a great job tweaking the storyline to Wakanda after the unfortunate death to the actor that played King T’Challa ( Chadwick Aaron Boseman) .

"Worst marvel movie hands down. Good acting but absolutely horrendous writing. Nothing about the movie makes any sense. From water bombs, a guy having little wings on his ankles that make him fly super fast, or a people who can't live on the surface being able to carry out a successful attack on the surface. Plus so many more ridiculous things. Clearly was a hastily written movie trying to pull a rabbit out of the hat after the passing of Chadwick Boseman. Can't believe a movie this bad made it to theaters. Clearly the good reviews came from people that believe in generational guilt.",blackpanthere
"This was a beautiful sendoff for Chadwick Boseman and great showing of respect for other cultures. Nakia, Okoye, and M'Baku were great again, and Queen Ramonda absolutely stole the show. Shuri as the new Black Panther just ain't it though, and dragged the movie down every scene she was in.",blackpanthere
"Wakanda Forever had big shoes to fill, and I was genuinely interested to see how the story would carry on after the first film. The sequel delivered more large scale scenes and action moments, yet somehow it didn’t feel as intensely action-packed as the first. That’s not a bad thing, it leaned more into spectacle, while the original carried heavier emotional and thematic weight through its quieter, dramatic dilemmas. What I really appreciated was how the sequel didn’t just try to replicate the first film. It built on it. The integrated story offered a fresh direction and development, rather than rehashing what had already been done. That choice made the movie feel purposeful and respectful to the world it was expanding. It’s hard to directly compare this to Black Panther, because the first one leaves a more lasting impact due to the nature of its story. But Wakanda Forever stands strong in its own place. Its an amazing film, meaningful in a different way, and a worthy continuation of the legacy.",blackpanthere
"il film più brutto che abbia mai visto in vita mia, avrei voluto cavarmi gli occhi e strapparmi le orecchie voto 0 su 1000, schifo totale",blackpanthere
"In a tragic way, you could feel a combination of characters and actors mourning the loss of Chadwick Bozman and T'Challa at the same time but it further strengthened the performances. Angela Bassett was truly legendary in this movie. There are parts of the movie that probably could have been left out because at 2 hours and 41 minutes it was definitely long and felt long, but Namor was truly a great villain and Letitia Wright stepped up from a side character to believable lead who was going through a gambit of different emotions after everything Shuri has been through.",blackpanthere
"This movie is really good, and I almost cried the entire time, still wasn't as good as the first one though. And was way to damn long",blackpanthere
"Such a tough movie where they needed to basically create an origin story again and also. The ascension of the new black panther is controversial, but the movie was gripping throughout. Huge climax in Wakanda. Solid end.... Still great movie. For those questioning why Shuri took the herb and nota better warrior. 1. She's royalty. 2. She made it. 3. She wanted revenge over her mother, so she wanted to kill him and she could've",blackpanthere
"I’m only a half hour in, and instead if paying attention to this movie, I’m writing this review. Paying tribute to Chadwick Bozeman is well deserved, but his absence is keenly felt in the mediocrity of this sequel. The continual thread of paying tribute becomes maudlin. Sorry, but Hollywood needs to find another way to keep this story alive.",blackpanthere
"People are seriously underrating this movie. Sure they could've just easily recast Chadwick, but common, it then would've looked as they didn't pay respect to his death! Overall this movie was amazing! Great way of paying a Tribute to Chadwick and his amazing career. Solid story and pacing, amazing acting, beatiful score and cinematography, heartbreaking moments and even some fun bits that didn't feel dragged. I'd call this movie a huge success! WAKANDA FOREVER!!!",blackpanthere
"Choppy pacing, incoherent conflict, and insincere dialogue. Not to mention a plot that overall feels like it was written for the sake of appealing to the average fan's political views rather than meaningful address existing themes and issues in the MCU universe. Decent actors, amazing costume and visual design, and energetic soundtrack leaves this movie as a piss poor sequel to the original Black Panther movie.",blackpanthere
"I loved the direction Black Panther: Wakanda Forever took with its story, especially how respectfully and poignantly it handled Chadwick Boseman's passing. While the film is entertaining enough and boasts some truly powerful moments, it ultimately suffers from its excessive runtime and feels overstuffed with one too many narrative threads vying for attention.",blackpanthere
"I’m appreciative of how the movie represented our late, yet great, Chadwick Boseman. I wish that Suri wasn’t so blinded by loss that she couldn’t automatically stick to her roots as well as adding her own flavor to the Black Panther legacy. As a black woman myself. I do not hesitate to pay homage to my ancestors and that is all I see in women of color all around the world. Suri is of my culture, her second guessing her roots is not of our blood. And yet, it was still a good watch aside from this large mishap.",blackpanthere
"Tenoch Huerta brought LIFE into Namor!!! His reasons for protecting Talokan were justified in my opinion. Not recasting T'Challa was a HUGE mistake, which should've been addressed. Chadwick Boseman would've wanted T'Challa to be recasted. The Mother was not seeing reason, and wouldn't listen to reason. The story would've been A LOT better if a new actor played T'Challa. This whole script felt like a money grab honestly",blackpanthere
"Amazing villain, Emotional performances, innovative action and heavy emotional weights. It's a solid marvel film. The only thing holding it back is it's deliberateness to push Riri and Shuri as the new Iron Man and Black Panther and some contrived plot points, but otherwise, Wakanda forever is a great film.",blackpanthere
"It has really good bones, and most of the meat on them is prime, but there are a couple things that were very out of place. SPOILERS The themes of loss, of being reluctant to let go of lost loved ones, of that resentment poisoning you - all great. Losing the heart-shaped herb in BP seems to have been pointless, since they bring it back and that's what lets them win. It would have been better if Shuri's strength in technology was what let her overcome Namora, rather than relying on the mysterious powers of the herb. Have her recreate the herb after achieving victory without it. She sends M'Baku as a proxy to the challenge at the end?! Is this just a big FU to ancient tradition and the entire nation? Is she abdicating the throne?! It makes no sense. What's up with the hidden heir? That didn't work well with Killmonger.",blackpanthere
This film did its best to make a good storyline and plot without THE black panther R.I.P Chadwick Boseman and i think it succeeds to give the mantle to Shuri. Great movie,blackpanthere
"The scene in the beginning broke my heart cuz we lost the king of Wakanda. I love that even if he didn't got to play it anymore, Chadwick Aaron Boseman, he will always be the king, and the honor of being the next Black Panther in this movie was amazing Letitia Wright did an amazing job.",blackpanthere
"I am gobsmacked at the review scores, Black Panther is in the top 5 of best MCU. Unfortunately the sequel is an absolute bomb, Thor: The Dark World quality, and really not worth watching. A real shame.",blackpanthere
"I feel like the original film was better than the sequel as far as story progression. The movie was intriguing to watch, in deciding how to pick up after Chadwick Boseman’s death and the ending was surprising as well.",blackpanthere
"Black Panther Wakanda forever is a heartfelt and emotional tribute to Chadwick Boseman and you can feel it in the core and the heart of this film, but it’s still has moments to move the story along and breathe new elements within the Marvel universe while doing it. Ryan Coogler was able to blend great direction Along with the very moving story of dealing with the passing of Chadwick Boseman along with adding other elements within the story, including Neamor and his heartfelt and emotional story of how his people were forced from their land and had to resort to other means of surviving in the ocean, combined with the emotional story of Wakanda and how they are dealing with the loss of the Black Panther and trying to move forward, the blend of all the different stories coming together along with moving the MCU forward as well was beautifully done and is a beautiful successor to the original Black Panther.",blackpanthere
"I finally got the time to watch and Ryan Coogler did it again. Not only was this next installment a beautiful work of art, this film truly embraced EVERYTHING that we, the fans have come to ❤️ about Marvel Studios and specifically Wakanda but, this film brought a level of truthfulness, honor, dedication, determination, respect & humanity to this franchise and Cinematic Universe. I can without doubt say this film was my favorite installment within the MCU that showed a rawness of emotion that grounded these characters. I like many fell in love with Mr. Bosman as the Black Panther but, Letitia Wright made me realize that Shuri indeed was the right choice to give Black Panther the heroic rebirth of it’s legacy that it deserved! I can’t wait to she her take on the legacy! Ryan Coogler knows what he’s doing and deserves all the flowers out there! And I’ll keep saying this, I will NEVER get over how absolutely phenomenal of a Storyteller Ryan is! He’s achieving greatness with his life and he’s putting that into his work and it shows! He’s continuation of modernizing of history, calling out & re-writing of history will forever make him one of my all time favorite artists and humans!",blackpanthere
"Worthy successor to BP1! It maintains the high stakes tone established early in the movie. Great choreography, music, and action. Lesser CGI quality later in the movie, and some of the late story choices felt out of place. But overall very good",blackpanthere
"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a heartfelt and emotional continuation of the Black Panther saga. The film does an incredible job honoring Chadwick Boseman, and the performances, especially from Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett, are powerful. The action scenes are solid, and the world-building remains impressive. However, the pacing can feel uneven at times, and some storylines don’t quite reach their full potential. Still, it’s a worthy and respectful sequel that leaves a lasting impact.",blackpanthere
"“Wakanda Forever” is a powerful tribute to Chadwick Boseman and a bold step forward for the Black Panther story. Letitia Wright truly shines as Shuri, and the emotions run deep throughout the film. The visuals are stunning, and Namor is a strong, complex villain. It’s not just a superhero movie — it’s a story about grief, leadership, and legacy. A respectful, emotional, and thrilling sequel.",blackpanthere
"The production of the movie was butcherd by covid and I regret that they didn't recast chadwick, but what they did was awesome. Almost everything was great with some holes, i think that angela basett was snubed at the oscars because sje was tooooo great, the effects, score, villian.... nice and totaly recomend it.",blackpanthere
"Disappointed that they made the new black panther so unlikable. I loved her in the first movie. In this one, not really at all. Did not like that she maimed another character.",blackpanthere
To be blunt this film should of recasted chadwick boseman black panther. it leaves a lot to be desired and i really cannot get behind the sister taking up the mantle. her character just doesn’t have what baseman’s character did,blackpanthere
The tribute to Bozeman and his death was really a tear jerker. But the undertone of African people fighting Latain people over a natural resource they both have which was instigated by USA. They fact that it made the whole Latain vs African a thing which it has never been. Hate that Disney thinks this is okay. But Song of the South is real too.,blackpanthere
I can't take it anymore. Watching this made me feel like bugs wanted to break out of my skin while being covered in duct tape. It is so corny and so boring. Never again.,blackpanthere
"Characters like Namor and Rawanda carry this movie to success. The emotions are heavy and the plot is fun. Some moments are too silly considering the dark tone of the rest of the film, but past that, this is a worthwhile endeavor.",blackpanthere
"This movie had some great performances by the actors and a lot of incredible visuals, but the story and plot were not very compelling and did not really resonate with me. It was fun to watch, and I definitely recommend it for superhero fans.",blackpanthere
"Human life crosses movie, in a delightful deep delicate plot. I've decided to show to my kids since I feel is proposing death and grief and life joy as no other content could, leveraging real cultures able to do so in my opinion better than Europeans. Fun and action and novelty eg underwater civilization make it enjoyable without hiding the challenges and lections of the core. Very very good!",blackpanthere
"A great sequel to the first movie that expands on the world of both Wakanda and Marvel. A beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman that feels like a piece of him will live on forever. On top of that an absolutely stunning movie with some of the best visuals I’ve ever seen, great themes, and plot. Highly recommend.",blackpanthere
Black panther was great. Wakanda forever was horrible. I see so many people liked it. I doubt many of them know Prince Namor. Having a nonathletic actor-and jazzing him up by giving him a teenage goatee and putting a buch of **it in his face was downright demoralizing. WHY?? So painful to watch one of Marvels toughest characters just to make him look silly in green boxer briefs and getting his ass kicked by B-level Marvel nobodies. Shame on you. Shame on you. This madness must stop.,blackpanthere
It's a good movie. That I haven't seen for a long time. What I like about this movie is. That they respected Chadwick Boseman. And didn't replace him. After his death. That they gave his character a funeral.And also that they made Shuri in some way relatable.,blackpanthere
"The first twenty minutes of the film will make you cry. The last twenty minutes will make you ask, ""Why?"" An excellent film with an ending that could have been a whole lot better",blackpanthere
"A long and sometimes gruelling watch. But one that is worth it, due to powerful performances and an emotional tribute to the legendary Chadwick Boseman.",blackpanthere
"I have to say the first time I watched this movie I thought it was the best movie, the only thing that brought it down to 4 stars is the fact that it is not rewatchable.",blackpanthere
"One of the best post endgame marvel movies, slow and serious, sad and profound , Nemor was a great villian and the best and definitive female superhero movie",blackpanthere
Wakanda has an amazingly rich lore and. This film abuses the absolutely amazing Wakandian mythos to push a narrative that gets in the way of good story telling.,blackpanthere
A poignant and exciting sequel that excels against the odds of losing its beloved protagonist and lead actor by striving with its strong cast of side characters coping with their loss and finding solidarity amongst other technologically advanced indigenous nations in an increasingly globalized neo-colonial world.,blackpanthere
Young college girl illegally making money by making and selling stark level tech and becomes the next Ironman. Sure... Setup some believable characters with substance for the next phase. Lack luster plot and messy.,blackpanthere
"This movie seemed to drag on. Fight scenes were boring. Characters seemed to be introduced only for the point of getting another person on the screen, not advancing the story. Plot lines were drenched in over the top ""let-me-teach-you-a-lesson"" themes. Also, did the movie have an editor? It could have used one.",blackpanthere
"O Filme e emocionante o que mais adoro nesse filme e o equilíbrio do humor e das cenas tristes que faz você chorar e que não perde a essência de um filme do pantera negra, quando você ver as piadas você automaticamente saber que as piadas tem a essência do Pantera Negra não só as piadas mas também as cenas de luta, de suspense, etc.. são tudo que um filme do Pantera Negra precisa. Uma bela homenagem ao ator que fazia o antigo Pantera Negra...",blackpanthere
"My biggest criticism with this movie is that it just kind of felt bland and boring to look at. Besides Namor’s inclusions, it felt very modern-day Marvel in the visuals aspect and wasn’t very inspired in the action scenes, however, the simple traditions, dresses, suits, and cultural aspects of Wakanda are always amazing. The movie itself is fine, the story does serve well for the characters, and had some twists and turns that were enjoyable. Mostly, it was just a fine movie with good moments and some good characters, but without Chadwick Boseman, it sort of feels like the whole thing was hobbled together.",blackpanthere
"Story very disjointed, lead character of Shuri & Ari Ari Williams was definitely not the right actor to lead the cast. Saving graces Martin Freeman, Winston Duke & Angela Bassett & the send off of Chadwick Boseman was excellent Some really bad story lines in there. With the greatest technology in the world you have one of the main characters cutting steel with an oxy torch. Unfortunately this move along with the Eternals has started the sad decline of the Marvel Universe",blackpanthere
"""Pantera Negra: Wakanda Para Sempre"" é um filme que merece 5 estrelas, homenageando Chadwick Boseman e expandindo o universo de Wakanda de forma emocionante. A direção de Ryan Coogler é excepcional, equilibrando ação intensa com profundidade emocional, enquanto o elenco, incluindo Letitia Wright e Angela Bassett, entrega atuações memoráveis. A cinematografia é deslumbrante e as sequências de ação são eletrizantes. O filme aborda temas como luto e resistência, celebrando a cultura africana e fazendo uma representação inclusiva. Em resumo, é uma experiência cinematográfica poderosa e impactante que honra seu predecessor e estabelece um novo caminho para Wakanda.",blackpanthere
"Filme mais ou menos o roteiro é fraco, o vilão é fraco, o filme faz uns homenagem ao pantera negra verdadeiro que era bom, mas infelizmente ele morreu, e no filme as cenas de ação foram bacanas, mas não o suficiente para melhorar o filme, e nos créditos colocaram um moleque para ser o pantera negra, invetaram um filho do pantera negra só por que ele morreu, e foda-se",blackpanthere
"Only 4 stars because Angela Bassett's character (the Queen of Wakanda)dies in this movie. Whatever her character is, Angela Bassett is an actual Movie Star (and not just some regular ol movie actress) an therefore, out of respect for her & her acting abilities, the character she plays must NEVER be killed in ANY production she is in.",blackpanthere
"A great film! I loved the opening tribute to Chadwick Boseman. I enjoyed the way Namor was portrayed. Ironheart was also a great character, but her armor looked a bit like a Power Ranger suit. Shuri did a great job taking on the mantle. Great story, wonderful acting, highly recommended!!",blackpanthere
"A good self contained sequel and a great character study, only thing holding this film back is the focus on Namor who feels disingenuous and misguided.",blackpanthere
"I'm not the biggest marvel movies geek, but I really liked this one a lot. Since it does not have the usual US-centristic point of view of most movies from hollywood. It's refreshing, original and very entertaining. I really liked the fact that men play a secondary role as well.",blackpanthere
It may not be the same since the passing of Chadwick Boseman but this sequel shows Marvel wants to continue the franchise as they’re willing to do whatever it takes.,blackpanthere
"This film goes beyond what people think. Yes, it's a fantastic way to honor Chadwick Boseman. But also, the character arch that Shuri has as the protagonist is incredibly well written. This film is an absolute masterpiece",blackpanthere
"“Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” tries to do too much, but it’s still a solid continuation of the first film and a heartfelt tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman with fantastic performances from Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett.",blackpanthere
"I am not sure how this got high ratings, the first film was great, this just seemed like a horrible cash in after a real life tragedy. Boring and wished I never saw it.",blackpanthere
"The start of this movie was kind of boring, I'll admit. The pacing was kind of slow until we get to like halfway into the movie when the main villain is introduced. I literally almost fell asleep in the movie theater like twice. I will say that this is probably the best Marvel movie of this year, which is pretty sad considering this movie wasn't even that good. 6/10",blackpanthere
"definitely the most contemplative marvel movie, to the point where the obligatory(and unfortunately average) action scenes sometimes feel like interruptions to a eulogy. the exploration of grief and it’s effect on faith was particularly compelling. easily toward the top of phase 4.",blackpanthere
"Many cool concepts, but a total MacGuffin plot. Love the Namor backstory. Beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman in the opening scenes. The execution was disjointed, overlong, overcomplicated.",blackpanthere
"I love how they made the story about honoring T’Challa while also introducing a whole new group of people and city. The visuals were amazing and you could feel everyone’s emotions. Run, don’t walk, to go see this movie",blackpanthere
They should of stopped after Bowsman died. The worst thing about this film is that it is not entertaining. The most interesting parts is the first 10 minutes and the Last 7 minutes.,blackpanthere
"It's not a bad movie, but I think this part is uninteresting and boring, as if they decided to make this part a documentary out of respect. The last part of the movie becomes more interesting, but still not without problems. The intrigue for the 3rd part is well done so I will wait for the next part",blackpanthere
Story is good for the circumstances they had to work with. The whole secret son thing is definetly forced but i can also see why they did it,blackpanthere
"Almost reaches the heights of the first movie. Shuri was great, so was the villain. The emotions really worked, and it’s just a smart movie.",blackpanthere
"Really was one of the worst ‘entertainment’ movies I have ever seen. Very slow, lacking in action and lacking in storyline. Winston Duke was still upbeat and enjoyable. Angela Bassett acted really well. Otherwise poor poor film!",blackpanthere
This movie was a great way to teach us the importance of loss and how it feels. It’s not just about superheroes but this movie shows what it means to feel something and that’s what Wakanda Forever teaches us and that’s why I love it so much. It’s a great way to respect and remember people who had died in the past. 🥹🥹🥹🥹,blackpanthere
"This movie was creative in its storyline not many could have pulled this off in the brilliant matter in which it was pulled off, a must see very entertaining film.",blackpanthere
Boseman is dead And so is this franchise Disney really needs to understand. We got to get away from the bright colors and get back to great story,blackpanthere
Okey hablando de las reseñas motivadoras y gratas creo q he la estás super sobrevalorando está bien que metan a la civilización olmeca a la peli pero iron heart enserio? Me puedes venir con una cosa de que no hay ninguna referencia a Tony y todo pero lit eso quisieron hacer o amenos de que no pensáramos ahí si márcale haz lo que quieras pero qué crees tienes fans con cerebro que si piensan da asco como quieren forzar algo déjenlo donde estaba y ya espero y cancelen la serie de iron heart,blackpanthere
"A little disappointing. The movie is way too long and has a little too much meaningless filler for me. The story is riddled with plot holes and poor writing. It has likeable characters and some fun action, but still, believe it or not, it is better than most of what Marvel releases nowadays.",blackpanthere
Such a beautiful production in spite of all the hurdles against it. Ryan Coogler doesn't get enough praise for his craftsmanship. Additionally probably THE strongest cast in the MCU franchise and marvel should be investing in them more than they are.,blackpanthere
The movie was OK defiently not as good as the first. Namor was bad but Iron Heart was even worse. The original you can watch a few times and still enjoy this one you watch once and it's more than enough. I'd never buy it too own it thats for sure,blackpanthere
Got to admit I only watched 30min of it but blah. Terrible and I couldn't finish it. Left and next day I asked my son if I missed anything and he said he hated it and turned it off 20min later.,blackpanthere
"As a tribute, as a Marvel film and as a sequel, Wakanda Forever delivers a visual, emotional and engaging experience, and excellent performances from the cast.",blackpanthere
"This movie did justice not only to marvel fans everywhere, but to those also grieving Chadwick Boseman. It almost seems as if Marvel created this movie in honor of him. They still got to give the plot lines necessary for the legacy to continue in addition to honoring the memory of the late king of Wakanda.",blackpanthere
"Me gustó bastante, es una hermosa película con una historia interesante, buena calidad de producción y actuaciones. La única razón por la que le otorgó 4 estrellas, es es debido a algunos aspectos, que no me gustaron, de la representación de la cultura Mexicana, que yo como Mexicana puedo juzgar ampliamente.",blackpanthere
malisima todo esto de que solo mujeres peleen WTF tienen que ser mas realistas en una guerra quien haria algo asi o que les paso a los hombres se extinguieron de golpe sin previo aviso??? que les pasa estan arruinando todas las peliculas,blackpanthere
"Where did this go wrong? It's way too long. The hole left by Chadwick Boseman's death was impossible to fill. The villain was weak and uninteresting. The whole plot felt like it was put together with scraps from ""Aquaman"" and ""Avatar.""",blackpanthere
"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a powerful and emotional superhero film that pays tribute to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman's portrayal of T'Challa. The movie delves deeper into the rich world of Wakanda, offering a compelling storyline, impressive performances, and breathtaking visuals. The themes of unity, tradition, and strength resonate throughout the film, making it a fitting sequel to the original Black Panther. Overall, Wakanda Forever is a heartfelt and well-crafted movie that honors its predecessor while setting the stage for new adventures in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",blackpanthere
"The only thing I liked about this movie was the Tribute to Chadwick Boseman. That was very touching. Angela Bassett performance was superb, sad she had to work with such a weak script. Uhh Shiri the actor is good. But her character?? Uhh what? She got jabbed through the abdomen and still survived? How?? This movie barely make sense after the tribute to Chadwick",blackpanthere
"Maybe it's just me but I just find the wankandans incredibly unlikeable. The society is supposedly built on honor etc but every time they face anybody that Is superior to them in hand to hand they need to develop all these weapons and suits to make themselves stronger and tilt the scales in their favour. Now I suppose for an American audience that never care about someone bringing a gun to a knife fight it's perfectly acceptable it just sits wrong with any person with an ounce of decency. The ending was horrid. A 100lb scientist suddenly defeats a superman type character ( no explanation as to why his super power was water and what exactly water could do to give him strength ) Beside she took him to a desert (beach) and he lost his strength( missing the whole tonnes of water vapour in the air around beaches 🫣) but not before he speared her and walked away leaving her stuck to a rock. Even after freeing herself (unbelievably) and facing down ""Villain"" again in his incredibly weakened state she uses a jet engine( which we had previously seen be destroyed) to fry him rather than face him in hand to hand combat. They just aren't heroes. They betrayed there own rules and culture in first film. This one is no better",blackpanthere
"Esse filme é incrível, as atuações, a cinematográfia do filme, a shuri se tornando a pantera negra, a TRILHA SONORA é INCRÍVEL, amei muito o filme.",blackpanthere
"Even though it's not quite as good as its predecessor and is just too long, Wakanda Forever has an excellent premise with the most emotionally impactful mid-credits scene of any movie I have ever watched.",blackpanthere
I get the tribute to Chadwick Boseman. He was the essence of BP and irreplaceable. But there was no point in making an entire movie dedicated to mourning his loss. I was depressed by the end of this movie.,blackpanthere
"Meh. It was a good effort, but it failed to captivate me. Do you know when you see an art installation in a gallery that you won't quite get if you don't have a long argumentative text explaining the meaning of the piece? This movie is like that. The plot is so overly and unnecessarily complicated that it needs long portions of stories within the film; the endless conversations make it dull and slow its pace tragically. The combination of the worlds is forced. The conflict between the two mythological nations and the real American CIA and Europe feels like putting chocolate on an egg/bacon sandwich is not a good match. The story of the sea people scrambling with the story of the actual Mayan civilization was too cartoonish and poorly made. The battle scenes were emotionless and to top it all, the attempts at humour are completely lame. This is not a movie I will be watching again.",blackpanthere
"Takes fiction to anotherrrrr level. Given all that's gone on in the MCU before this film and they've just sat out until now?! Then come back with a selfish ‘not part of your team' attitude when it's obvious what the universe has in store for them, makes this a very difficult film to watch. Not enjoyable.",blackpanthere
"A bit disappointed. The story had too much happening, detracting from the central narrative about Wakanda and the royal family's struggle to adapt to their new reality without T'Challa.",blackpanthere
"Succeeded on every level over the sequel. Will take some time to digest + will need a rewatch, but Wakanda Forever pays tribute to Chadwick Boseman while pushing its own story and the MCU forward. 8/10 for now. Edit: Def an 8.5-9/10 on a rewatch. Everything about it just works for me",blackpanthere
Chadwick passing is a tragedy.. but feels require more explainin with regards to why the talo khan combat capabilities varies so much from time to time,blackpanthere
"This might be one of my fauvorite Marvel movie ever, the story is really good, the script is fenomenal and Namor is the best villain on the marvel universe.",blackpanthere
"Weak writing, overwhelming bad plot. A peaceful underwater nation that's never had to fight all of a sudden is a direct rival to Wakanda. The reason for the fight is not a reason to fight its just bad character plot. My guess is the think tank was on low fuel. Not worth a watch",blackpanthere
This movie is so over rated the only positive things about the movie was the writing and some of the acting like m baku was probably the most entertaining but he barely had a role in this sequel. And the reason im giving this movie a half a star is because of m baku but either than that oh my God it's so boring I felt my head spinning because it was so boring. It never gets to the Point and the villan was the most boring part. You know what I am going to stop now because I could go on and on how bad this movie was.,blackpanthere
bad exposition to a new enemy force and new characters that will be important in the future of the mcu. the actors seem to not want to even be in this movie half of the time. strange how far marvel has fallen after endgame.,blackpanthere
A great tributary work for the artist who left. Mesmerizing visuals and colour schemes. However with the amounts of CGI during it's lengthy span was excessive. But when considered as a comic book adaptation it does manage to present all futuristic setups as usual. Great use of audio from start to end. Sharp audio effects use was a major part in action sequences. The colourful culture of Wakandans was well preserved in this new episode too. Dialogues weren't the sharpest and the idea of presenting Wakandans mad at world on the west was childish. It was a good move to empower a princess to suit up and save the nation.,blackpanthere
"Not much to like here for me -- portrayal of Namor was sub par, story had lots of holes, Shuri gets stabbed through the belly and barely acknowledges the after-effects, Namor conveniently kills the queen and then leaves so the heroes can regroup, just contrived logic so the movie can happen. The best part was the honoring of Chadwick Boseman.",blackpanthere
I really enjoyed it and it was emotional. I kinda wanted them to recast T'challa but it works. Great visuals and only 2 cringe lines,blackpanthere
This is a mixed bag of a movie I feel they killed off specific characters just beaucse they could.I feel a times they were being over dramatic it was just boring and slow at times overall a 2/5,blackpanthere
"I went into this movie expecting it to be good after checking the reviews only to be utterly letdown by the story, the CGI, and honestly everything about it. After the masterpiece that Black Panther was I so desperately wanted to love this movie but I could barely sit through it, one of the main complaints was the truly awful, and frankly irritating, villain. The idea it's self was good but it just wasn't executed in a compelling way, the characters just all felt so hollow and one dimensional. I have rewatched most of the marvel movies a few times and loved them every time, and I can very confidently say I would NEVER watch this again. It was just… disappointing.",blackpanthere
"Simply put. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. Definitely give it a watch if you enjoy Marvel movies, but it wasn't really good enough for me to want to watch it again. Felt like it used Chadwick's death to much to make the movie emotional, rather than just creating an actually decent movie, like it was a tribute to him. If they kept the same plot but Chadwick had not actually passed away in real life, I feel like it would have failed greatly plotwise. I realise they were in a tough position, but perhaps recasting him would have been more fitting.",blackpanthere
"I have never had a movie that represented my blood like this movie. I have never felt like a movie would make me cry but I teared up(if this movie was able to do that I wonder what movie would make me bawl). Villain wise Namor is probably one of the scariest yet down to earth villains I have seen in a movie. He brought an element I didn't know could be brought to Marvel. The reason this is at 5 stars isn't because of Namor being a S tier villain but Shuri as a character. She lost everything and in the end still chose what would save her people rather than giving up everything to the feeling of revenge. The representation of everything with Killmonger with her loss and with just her as a character I at a point was like ""stop taking so much from her"" not only am I proud to call her black panther but I am also glad to call her an S Tier character. Now for my shortest segment. My fiancee and I are afro latino. This movie represented us in a way a movie has never represented us before. The music, the scenery, everything. I can 100% vouch we all live under water like that. Absolute detail to detail accurate. Probably the best movie Marvel has ever made and I NEED MORE MOVIE.",blackpanthere
"There is a Chadwick Boseman-shaped hole in the heart of Wakanda. While this film offers a lovely tribute to King T'Challa and the man who played him, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever feels like it's missing something (which is kind of funny, because the runtime is far too long). Even Shuri (Letitia Wright), who was one of my favorite parts of the first Black Panther movie, becomes a dull, brooding character in this sequel. Watching this was an almost joyless experience, despite the forced humor. Phase Four of the MCU has been a bit of mess, so I was hoping it would end strong. Unfortunately, it didn't.",blackpanthere
"This Movie truly honours the legacy of Chawick Boseman and pays tribute to him in many ways, it has one of the best villains of the phase with namar and has some emotional and heartbraking moments throughout. also has some of the best acting in the entire MCU with is oscar worthy. 9.0/10. the costume designs are incredible.",blackpanthere
"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever With an emotional intro, this sequel gives a befitting send-off to the character T'Challa and the brilliant actor Chadwick Boseman. This sequel may not best or match the previous movie, but it moves the story forward convincingly. Character development is done aptly, especially for Shuri. The Talokan underwater scenes could have been improved upon, the transcendent feel of that world was tame. The biggest praise for Black Panther 2 is the acting. The returning cast members deliver splendid performances (Angela Bassett did the thing), and the new members also match up (Tenoch Huerta Mejía giving a compelling performance.) The score is also wonderful. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a strong sequel even though it has writing flaws and pacing issues. 7/10",blackpanthere
The first 10 minutes were amazing and I cried because of how emotionally moving it was. I spent the rest of the movie crying because of how wretchedly horrible the movie was.,blackpanthere
"The follow-up to the hugely popular Black Panther, which earned itself several Academy Award nominations back in 2019, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever had a tough job following the tragic death of actor Chadwick Boseman. Filming was interrupted with rewrites prompting reshoots as the film's release was delayed and Letitia Wright's controversial time on Twitter didn't help matters much. Wakanda Forever was tasked with building on the first film and concluding Marvel's Phase 4 as a new villain enters the picture, and a new hero is forced to step up and become the Black Panther. Wakanda is pressured by the rest of the world to share its vibranium resource, but Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett) refuses so these political headbutts soon start to cause dangerous ripples. The bad guy this time is Namor, played by Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who breaks into Wakanda, threatening the country with an attack if he is not given the scientist who designed a machine capable of detecting vibranium. Losing the main actor in the franchise was always going to prove challenging for the filmmakers but the approach taken here feels appropriate: after T'Challa is given a considerable, moving send-off, the story continues and Shuri (Letitia Wright) eventually assumes the mantle. Having not one but two massive funerals in a film as lengthy as this one does hurt the pacing of the movie quite a bit, however. This is definitely a film that could have done with a bit of a trim but one suspects that necessary changes to the script caused the budget to inflate too much already so changing the entire plot was not really an option, which is understandable. All of that aside, this is a good sequel and the best film in Marvel's Phase 4 by far. The action sequences are big and exciting, the cast is on top form, there's plenty of drama and intrigue to hold onto, Namor is an interesting foe who lives in a bit of a grey area like Killmonger did and the new culture that is introduced is fascinating. The film takes what worked so well in the first Black Panther and puts it on a more global scale. On the minus side, the introduction of Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) falls resoundingly flat and Lupita Nyong'o is barely given anything to do as Nakia, a character that has felt criminally underwritten since the first movie. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever isn't a perfect film by any stretch, and it's hardly one of Marvel's very best, but it remains a thoroughly entertaining sequel with new environments to discover, characters going through a lot emotionally and a well done build-up to an all-out war that is worth the watch alone.​Solid.",blackpanthere
"Inferior to its predecessor for sure. It was not bad, I had strong praise with the performances, tribute to Chadwick boseman, and some of the action scenes. I thought this movie was too long and should be cut down by like 15 to 20 minutes or so. Could've been better.",blackpanthere
Solid movie. I don't think it quite lived up to the first film. Plot was kind of all over the place and some scenes were just unnecessary for the film. Overall worth a watch. Chadwick was honored in the best way possible,blackpanthere
"Better than the first and yet mentions chadwick's unfortunate death, doesnt fully rely on it and still creates a new original story. Namor is a villain who is just trying to protect his people but does it in a radicalised way.",blackpanthere
Es increíble es mejores de marvel Namor es buen villano Shuri es increíble me encanta todo esta película es muy triste llore demasiado en esta película es un 9.4 de 10,blackpanthere
"A beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman, but after that it's just filler in a slow and boring film, well-choreographed and beautiful scenes, but I don't buy the ideas that this film sells to me and Marvel continually takes away the weight of other films with idiotic solutions of recent films.",blackpanthere
"The music, action, and story was so awesome. The scene with the Princess's entrance as the Black Panther paired with the BRILLIANT music that played was one of the best superhero entrance's of all time. Namor was a great villain. Top notch flick!",blackpanthere
"This movie is one of the best to come out of the MCU (not counting the Avengers movies), up there with Spider-Man: No Way Home. The best thing about this movie was the acting. Everybody from the last Black Panther movie were significantly better here. Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett specifically had some of the best performances out of any Marvel movie. Another great thing is the character writing. Shuri is my favorite character because of this movie. She's not an average selfless hero. She cares for her people yes, but her motivations are much more driven by her family. And despite people liking to call her a Mary Sue, she is far from one. She fails in this movie a lot. She also is much more vengeful than many heroes and her arc is overcoming that vengeance. Riri is also better written here. Even with her limited amount of screentime, Coogler's Riri is a better version of Ironheart than Bendis'. Namor was also a pretty good villain. He is worse than Kilmonger, but he is written much better than the majority of anti-heroes. This movie also expanded Wakandan culture and represents Africa well. The CGI was okay and could pass. But CGI was way too evident in this movie. Everett Ross was almost entirely unneccessary and took away from the screentime other characters could've had. His subplot didn't contribute to this movie's plot much either. Riri was set up to be an important character in the first act, but somewhere during act two, she was not used much and I think that's a shame With that being said, I highly recommend this movie.",blackpanthere
"I swore I would never watch the sequel after Chadwick died. He was Black Panther, it would be pointless without him. I changed my mind and started to watch it as they didn't try to replace him, but I can't get through more than half of the film without realising that it's nothing without him. Even the glorious, beautiful, unfairly talented Angela Bassett can't make me watch the rest. Chadwick was Black Panther...nothing less will do.",blackpanthere
I was taken a back by how much I enjoyed this movie. It portrays a great deal of emotion and respect to the late Chadwick Boseman. Shuri takes over and does brilliantly in this female led movie.,blackpanthere
A cast made up of supporting role actors does not a good movie make. This movie is very boring. It feels completely hollow. Most of these MCU movies since Endgame are directionless and leading to nowhere. Paling in comparison to it's predecessor.,blackpanthere
"The cast is perfect, the story is powerful, and the character development is wonderful. Still, Wakanda Forever feels like more of an epilogue to the first Black Panther than its own movie",blackpanthere
"Finally got a chance to watch this. Solid movie. I went into it with very low expectations and walked away really liking it. I found it a little different than the average Marvel movie, which was very refreshing. Its more human than other movies in the franchise. The cast was excellent. This was well made, and the story was interesting. Definitely gonna buy it for the collection.",blackpanthere
"Quite underwhelming in a lot of respects, with much less impact than the first film. The dialogue felt more annoying and the side characters and villains are worse - Klaue and Killmonger felt exciting to watch, unlike their replacements.",blackpanthere
"Is Black Panther: Wakanda Forever a good film you should watch? Yes, it is entertaining and offers a different emotional side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe we hardly get to experience. Despite the very sad and harsh tragedy, everyone needed to deal with, the movie is successful in working with what it has to make another good entry into the MCU. It's a moment for everyone to grieve, process, and dust off in preparation for what is next. Wakanda Forever is not as enthusiastic or lighthearted as other movies, not by choice, but manages to close out Phase 4 definitively.",blackpanthere
"I can honestly say, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has once again came back at it with a flawless marvel cinematic storytelling, especially with a herioc tribute to King T'challa, and the princess being the new black panther has definetely move the story forward. Chadwick Boseman would be so proud. Rest well Chadwick. As The People of Wakanda always Say: WAKANDA FOREVER!",blackpanthere
"This was a really good movie, especially given the circumstances. While it doesn't come close to being as good as the first one, this movie really had its moments. Angela Bassett should have won MULTIPLE awards for her performance in this movie. She was breathtaking at times. At the same time, I thought Shuri was very-much-so lacking in comparison to TChalla, BUT I thought Namor was right up there in comparison with Kilmonger, being one of the best villains the MCU has seen. The scene where people were jumping off the ship because of the Atlanteans singing gave me goosebumps and chills at how good it was, and that first fight scene on the ship with Wakandans was epic. All of the scenes and music that were underwater were absolutely fantastic, and could watch over and over again, and some of the fight scenes were really well done. Did not care for Riri's character at all, and I found most moments with her to be cringe. Nevermind how bad the cgi and design of her suit was. Overall, gave it a 86.2/100. Go see for yourself!",blackpanthere
"Overall strong, but a bit clunky. Trying to provide setup and payoff for too many characters at once. If Shuri had the same spotlight in this film that T'Challa did in the first then I believe it would have worked even better. We got another sympathetic villain but the movie didn't even require a conventional villain with all the internal strife that was going on.",blackpanthere
The first black panther set the bar very high that Wakanda Forever can't match the level but still it's a good movie. Rip Sir Chadwick Boseman😔,blackpanthere
An fantastic movie! A nice tribute for Chadwick Boseman. Loved the ocean themed for the villain. Nice way to end Phase 4 of the MCU.,blackpanthere
an amazing movie probably even better than the first one. I loved the movie and they had all the reason in the world to cancel this movie but they didn't. The beginning was a little confusing with the namor part but the way handled the death of tchalla was really appropriate.,blackpanthere
It really is a beautiful homage to Chadwick Boseman while also being a good standalone BP movie as it progresses. Definitely a great send-off to Marvel's phase 4,blackpanthere
"Marvel continues along a path littered with tired stories and unearned action set pieces that mix with flashy colors and one-liners and culminate in a lukewarm tribute for the late Chadwick Boseman. The thin plot that supports this films nearly three hour runtime consists of a intercontinental search for vibranium that accidentally uncovers an ancient civilization of, essentially, merpeople that are also quite advanced thanks to their unfettered access to vibranium. The merpeople threaten the existence of Wakanda and therefore they must be stopped. It's all so superficial now that many of the Marvel plotlines feel like unfinished first drafts. The acting is solid enough, without any glaring issues and the special effects look as great as always. It's the writing that continually sets Marvel movies up for failure, or at least disappointment. It's the universe in which the movies inhabit that's distracting as well. At this point the world is so convolutedly different than our own that it can be hard to get invested in the film's presented stakes, which is a charge that could be levied at any number of recent Marvel entries. All told, this Wakanda felt like it took forever to move along and, by the time we make it to the end credits, we're left wondering if we really went anywhere at all.",blackpanthere
"Lovely touching moments for Chadwick but outside of this I found Wakanda Forever a disconnected from its origin story. Characters who I loved from the first movie were ruined and I felt very underwhelming after watching it. Apart from Galaxy and Spiderman, Phase 4 has been a massive disappointment.",blackpanthere
"Long enough to explain the plot and characters. Chadwick's death is still sad, I don't know if this movie pays enough homage to him, but it's not bad. It may have bad things, but it is more than decent. The third act is pretty weak.",blackpanthere
"This movie was ok. I enjoyed myself, but Black Panther is simply not the same without Chadwick Boseman. However, this movie's dedication to the actor was great. RIP.",blackpanthere
"While it may contain strong performances and serves as an emotional tribute to Boseman's legacy, the movie ultimately is overlong, with a weak villain and an underwhelming final act, leading to a mixed experience that falls short of the impact of the original.",blackpanthere
"The costume design and overall look of the movie is beautiful, but the story is weak. While the first film was sustained by Chadwick Boseman's charisma, the second had to make do with a bunch of cocky characters who spent the whole time fighting each other. The war between Wakanda and Talokan ultimately proved unnecessary, as the two nations ended up in the same diplomatic situation they might have had right before the conflict; while the problem with the US simply ceased to exist without any explanation. Namor calling Spanish a ""hateful language"" and having his entire soundtrack feature songs sung in Spanish just showed that the director had no idea what he was doing.",blackpanthere
I don't really like how it's almost 3 hours (and it blue balled me with no doctor doom) but it was good with shuri facing the difficultys without t'challa (rip Chadwick Bozeman) and with namor being around killing the queen made her a cool black panther and I know everyone hates ironheart but me personally I enjoy her and I can't wait for her series,blackpanthere
I loved the movie good way to honor Chadwick for the movie the best thing his the music and fighting scenes in it still number one movie in America,blackpanthere
"As with Doctor Strange, the sequel isn't as good as the original. As with the first BP, it's about 25-30 minutes too long, and contrary to several opinions I've heard, it's not the funeral section at the start that drags. It's the superhero bits.",blackpanthere
"Ok, yes. Black Panther was sooo much better than this. But you to admit that this was amazing for a sequel. It's hard to follow such a blockbuster anyways. The soundtrack was amazing along with the effects. This is a movie you want to see on imax for the amazing visuals. When they go underwater it literally transports u into a whole new world along with the song playing. The villain was sooooo good, best MCU villain in my opinion. Do watch!",blackpanthere
"Black Panther - Wakanda Forever is probably the most emotional Marvel film of all time. After the sad death of former lead actor Chadwick Boseman, Marvel Studios faced a big challenge! How should they proceed with the planned sequel to Black Panther without the main actor? And it's safe to say they had probably the best solution. The film is simply a superhero masterpiece. We follow the journey of Shuri, we see how she has to deal with one blow after another and we see how she has to deal with the grief and anger that eats away at her. You have succeeded perfectly in turning Shuri from a marginal character into a real lead. They were also able to flesh out the supporting characters very clearly. Danai Gurira as General Okoye was again great, as was the entire cast. Okoye also gets a bigger arc in this film than before. She has to deal with her biggest fear, the loss of her title as General of the Dora Milaje. Nakia and M'Baku were also great again, though I would have liked to see more of the them. The two absolute scene stealers are Tenoch Huerta as Namor and Angela Bassett as Ramonda. Namor is arguably one of the best Marvel villains, with a good story and exciting powers, he makes you want more. Ramonda is probably the secret star of the film. Not only does she deliver arguably the most emotional scenes, but she is a great character for the main plot. Angela Bassett performs Oscar ripe. Newcomer Riri Williams aka Ironhearth is also convincing. She is a fun and likable side character with cool action scenes, even if Iron Man Fanboys probably don't see it that way. The action in the movie is great and also the CGI is mostly very good. Especially the underwater city Talokan can convince. The interplay of image and music is perfect. The film probably offers the most beautiful film music in the MCU. The film is quite long, but you don't notice that at all. The quiet pace gives the characters enough time to develop and make us understand how they feel and why they act the way they do. Goosebumps and tears are unavoidable. Alone the this time quiet Marvel intro with pictures and videos of Chadwick Boseman brings tears to your eyes. You can feel the real emotions in this film and that makes it even more powerful. In conclusion, Wakanda Forever is an absolute emotional masterpiece in the superhero industry that has no equal. It manages to honorably say goodbye to Chadwick and at the same time honorably begin a new story.",blackpanthere
"This was an emotional tribute to Chadwick. Even as an MCU fan, I didn't care about the MCU watching this one. I cared about the message and the tribute. Both were done well.",blackpanthere
"So many questions about this movie plot. And my pet hate is when villains seem to change how strong they are depending on what character is fighting them. Sorry, did not enjoy. Loved original Black Panther.",blackpanthere
"König T´Challa ist tot. Seine Schwester Shuri (Letitia Wright) und die Königin Ramonda (Angela Bassett) trauern und müssen dafür sorgen, dass Wakanda ein sichererer Ort bleibt. Shuri findet ein neues Volk, welches Unterwasser lebt und ebenfalls Vibranium besitzt und in Gefahr gerät bekannt zu werden. Der König Namor (Tenoch Huerta) möchte sein Volk beschützen und ist zu allem bereit. Gibt es Frieden? Ist Wakanda noch stark genug, ohne seinen König und Black Panther? Und wer wird der neue Black Panther? Black Panther Wakanda Forever ehrt am Anfang und am Ende den verstorbenen Black Panther Darsteller Chadwick Boseman. Dies macht er sehr gut und es ist auch emotional anzusehen. Shuri ist in diesem Film der Hauptcharakter und ist hier ernster und reist nicht mehr so viele Witze wie im ersten Teil. Dies liegt daran, da sie in starker Trauer ist. Das kann, aber auch daran liegen, da sie ja jetzt die Hauptdarstellerin ist und es für uns Zuschauer zu nervig wäre, wenn sie zu viel redet und nur Gags macht. Der Film generell wirkt nicht wie ein MCU Film. Es gibt eigentlich keine Erwähnung, anderer Superhelden oder Schurken. Am Anfang denkt man, dass der Film in die politische Richtung gehen wird, was zum Teil auch der Fall ist, aber meiner Meinung nach hätte es noch ein bisschen mehr sein können. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Marvelprojekten gibt es hier, weniger Action und mehr Charakterentwicklungen. Angela Bassett hat mir sehr gut gefallen und hat meiner Meinung nach zu Recht eine Oscarnominierung erhalten. Der Bösewicht des Filmes ist gut erzählt worden und könnte noch interessant für Fortsetzungen werden. Da man hier einen Bösewicht hat, dessen Motiv man nachvollziehen kann. Die Bewohner des Unterwasservolks sahen wie die Menschen aus Avatar aus und ich habe zwar Avatar nie richtig gesehen, aber die Handlung ähnelt sich schon stark. Der Endkampf war eher langweilig und einige Entscheidungen im Film fand ich nicht so toll z.b. was mit General Okoye gemacht wurde. Black Panther Wakanda Forever ist ein eher schwächerer Marvel Film, welcher zwar einen guten Ansatz hat und auch gute Szenen hatte. Aber am Ende hatte ich mir mehr erhofft und ich kann mir Shuri, nicht als neuen Black Panther vorstellen. 7,5/10",blackpanthere
"The fact in which they had to do a sequel in which the original star passed and still attempt to deliver a superior film in which they achieved, was remarkable and much respected as they showed love to the late and great Chad Boswick and original Black Panther in the film as well as tied it into the story line seamlessly which was impressive. Equally impressive was the cinematography which was not only better than the sequel but better than most films of recent date and the past. The action was good and they didn't have to force a new Black Panther but actually showed restraint and character development by having Black Panther be needed and by honoring him in the process rather than just replacing him. The Villans were mysterious and so intriguing and powerful, every scene with them was masterful. The Film had memorable scenes along with new surprises and characters and this is why it's one of Marvels best films especially under the circumstances. Bring on Part 3.",blackpanthere
"A great and entertaining tribute to Chadwich Boseman, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a great addition to the MCU with old and new characters, a well written antagonist, and serious tone. However, I do feel like Ironheart (Riri Williams) is just trying to be the next Ironman.",blackpanthere
"Terrible movie from start to end. This movie barley has any action scenes, story is super lame, no cool panther scenes, and they make Namor into a bit time WUSS even though in the comics he is is insanely strong. If your a fan of action movies with cool stories and character development then this movie IS NOT FOR YOU. Waste of time is what you'll get.",blackpanthere
Just plain not very good. Twice as long as it should have been. Lazy writing. So many pointless scenes. No depth to any of the characters. Par for the course for recent MCU titles.,blackpanthere
It is a shame the Black Panther actor was lost as he was a good actor in the role. This was entertaining but seemed very long. Interesting storyline and weveryone seemed to enjoy it.,blackpanthere
"Even With All of The Heaviness Of The Absence of Chadwick Boseman, Black Panther Wakanda Forever Still Manages To Be A Thrilling and Emotionally Uplifting Tribute To One of The MCU's Most Beloved Worlds and Characters.",blackpanthere
"Im not a fan of a lot of things from this movie like: character Iron Heart, weird changing greatness of screen, music for some scenes. But this was a great tribute for Boseman, plot was good and CGI too.",blackpanthere
The movie was just way too long and you could feel it being dragged throughout the movie and I don't know why namor seems more overpowered than anyone in the film,blackpanthere
"BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is the sequel to the highly successful Black Panther movie. It serves as a poignant tribute to the late Chadwick Boseman. To be honest, it's amazing how they were able to sustain the franchise in spite of Boseman's untimely demise. Powerful performances from the main cast, especially Angela Bassett, who gloriously played the Queen of Wakanda. Great acting by Leticia Wright as Shuri, Danai Gurira as Okoye and Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia. The events of the movie led to a war between the Wakanda and Talokan. I loved how they presented Namor, in spite of the changes. For me, it was interesting to see him as a Mayan/Aztec. I understand why they didn't use Atlanteans, but I like how they kept the aesthetics. Costume design was beautiful for both tribes. The visual effects and battle sequences were amazing. I agree with the critics and fans that this movie is a great way to move the MCU forward. It's almost as great as its predecessor.",blackpanthere
soooooooo disappointed.. was really looking forward to seeing this movie... they could of just not made a sequel and i would of been fine if i knew it would be this terrible/bad! wish i could give it a Negative 10 stars,blackpanthere
"I liked it more than I expected. Sure, this sequel isn't as good as the first Black Panther, but I couldn't stop watching it for a second. I love how grief was approached here, and I love Zhuri's personality, though I don't think her character will ever be charismatic. This movie's villain stands out from the others and his backstory was very interesting.",blackpanthere
"LOVE IT, which I always do. I did not like Angela Bassett getting killed and the new characters coming in more powerful than the main characters. Zhuri did an ok job being Black Panther. If they make a part 3, I will be there.",blackpanthere
Boring plot. Honestly it was a boring movie and I did not enjoy it at all. The CGI was messy and overall just a okay movie.,blackpanthere
"Following the amazing first film, Ryan Coogler returned to direct the sequel of Black Panther, and I was excited to see what he could do with this one. Now the movie was dealt a devastating hand with the loss of Chadwick Boseman and they do a pretty good job of both honoring his legacy and character with respect (as they should) and moving the MCU's story into the future. Letitia Wright's Shuri was by far the best candidate to fill the shoes of the Black Panther and she is good in the role and holds a great on-screen presence. Angela Basset gives a very compelling performance, Danai Gurira gives another great performance as Okoye, and Winston Duke keeps bringing new and great energy to M'Baku. This movie falls short with both its villain and its runtime. The movie feels way too long, it takes way too much time to get from point A to point B and the time they spend getting there is almost meaningless. I wasn't a fan of Namor as a villain I think he was another poorly written villain in the MCU especially to compare him to one of the best villains in the form of Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, as they want us to feel sympathetic towards him and they never were able to fully get that across in a good and meaningful way like they did with the film's predecessor. This film definitely isn't the worst Marvel has put out as of late, but it falls short of being considered the best.",blackpanthere
"I love most of the Marvel movies and this one was certainly no exceptions. The underwater world was beautifully done and reminded me of the great special effects of Awayaman, which I also loved. Angela Bassett was outstanding!",blackpanthere
"Great Movie for remembering Chadwick, not as good as the first one but I like the story line and the actors together. RIP Chadwick. WAKANDA FOREVER!",blackpanthere
Ryan Coogler balanced the movie very well and again created a potential antoganist. Pre climax was not that convincing except that the movie was good. Angela Bassett gave her best performance.,blackpanthere
"Vengeance has consumed us. We cannot let it consume our people. SHURI will definitely bring something more of herself as the new black panther. Being seen as almost non-compliant and hesitant with all the rituals of her brother and the rest of the individuals surrounding her in Wakanda she managed to integrate herself and her people's customs in the later part of the movie. This is a new age for Wakanda as the Princess takes over. I enjoyed the movie. The very rich and vibrant colors, cinematography, and transitions really changed dramatically. The song choice was perfect; it made the story cohesive, making the audience feel the overall mood for each scene.",blackpanthere
It's Avatar meets The Black Panther and Wakanda. Has it's moments of beauty and good action scenes but falls short of a top notch marvel movie. It's kind of somber without Chadwick and spoty at continuing the legacy at best. I don't see this as being a long running series with the cast and script like this. Might be and probably should be a farewell to the Black Panther movies sadly.,blackpanthere
"This movie is just very forgettable. Not the worst movie ever but I found myself rooting for the ""bad guys"" the whole time because they made the Wakandans and especially Shuri so unlikeable",blackpanthere
"This was not worthy of Chadwicks fantastic performance. A random teenage copycat iron man, clumbsy and cringeworthy dialogue and zero consistency. Characters becom unstoppable gods one moment to easily defeated weaklings the next depending on what the plot needed at the time. It felt like a bunch of 4 year olds took over the writing on this one and its really really sad. Had such high hopes but for me the first one was without question far superior to this. Not just in acting but more importantly, in the writing.",blackpanthere
"It's not the worst MCU movie, but it is definitely up there. It is definitely not boring, but it is very supid. I think this movie has the biggest amount of plot holes in the entire MCU. You are telling me 19-yo girl built an arc reactor and quantum computer from scrap parts? Fuck off film.",blackpanthere
"Honestly, the trailers didn't get my attention. Only went to see if it had any conection with future movies. My son was bored. Movie was OK until the ending. I should had waited for Disney+ release.",blackpanthere
"one of the most anticipated marvel movies of the past year and my oh my it hold to the hype! i loved the movie. from the visuals to the cast and teh cultural representation this one provided, wakanda forever becomes a new breath in the mcu, while still having that characteristic marvel tone. i think they did chadwick justice by honoring his legacy and showing the grief and respect, not only the characters but the actors as well, have for that man. they introduce two main characters, namor and riri, and they do it in a very subtle manor, making it seem natural and effortless. it had comedic moments, dramatic scenes and just action masterpieces, that combined with their incredible costumes, made the energy vibrate through the screen. the sad tone was felt throughout the movie, but the emotion it encapsuled and the closure they all in the end was just very comforting. the special effects were used very wisely and the back story they gave to the underwater tribe was genious. i loved that they are merging the stories from the series with the ones from the movies, specially when it's done as good as it was seen in this film. the only down points i got from it were that apart from namor, the other underwater tribe people were mostly unseen and the fact that we didn't get a proper post credit scene. like what?! i live for that shit. anyways, this iconic cast was back and they gave us a movie enriched with traditions that trascended the multiverse and converged with the fiction this world provides. from political troubles to familiar bounds and people that become your chosen family, this one got to my heart and it didn't dissapoint at all! can't wait to see what's in storage for this characters next and how wakanda is going to evolve from the events of this cinematic gem <3",blackpanthere
"Wakanda Forever is a solid sequel to the original. Especially with everything happening behind the scenes. The fact that this movie stuck the landing is a triumph alone. Namor is dope and the changes made him more interesting to me as a non-namor fan. I wish Talocan was more magic based than having vibrainium. The final battle could've been better & agent Ross feels pointless in this movie. Riri was dope, but I wish her role was smaller and M'Baku's role be bigger.",blackpanthere
"One of the better Marvel movies, with well-acted, well-written characters and rich world-building. The story is more interesting than most superhero films, and the opening scene is, for obvious reasons, very moving. However, the film suffers the common Marvel fault of being too long a film for the type of film it is, which saps the dramatic tension somewhat in the second act. Overall an enjoyable watch, just wish it had been shorter.",blackpanthere
Possibly the dumbest marvel film to date. Its weird how your supposed to support a bunch on racists and nationalist zeolites...in fact its exactly like the usa but we are supposed to like wakanda,blackpanthere
"Very emotional, great fight scenes, and enjoyed the music. Unfortunately, the portrayal of Sub-Mariner was just wrong, even though the actor did a decent job. Also, why was the college girl introduced into the storyline? Just seemed forced and made zero sense. Also, why is the humor so bad in Black Panther movies? They try to be funny, but always miss the mark. Disney and the Marvel still can't find the magic of the original MCU.",blackpanthere
"So boring I slept in the cinema. Story is terrible, characters are terrible, special effects are horrible, editing is terrible… nothing to save in this poor illustration of what's coming out of Hollywood productions. You wouldn't think they could do worse than the first one but they managed to decuple the degree of what was already bad to an unwatchable experience. Also, Marvel/Disney don't respect special effect artists anymore, for that alone I would give a negative score, 0.5 will do.",blackpanthere
A very visually stunning movie filled with pretty much nothing. how it starts is how it ends by only introducing the equivalent counterpart of Nick Fury with motives of how easy it is to obtain a vibranium-made steel alloy shield,blackpanthere
"Like a lot of Marvel movies, it was probably a bit too long, but it was still one of the better comic book movies I've watched. Great homage to Chadwick.",blackpanthere
The film is slow and is too focused on the lack of first Black Panther (Chadwick). The last fight is ridiculous in some situations. I expect that in the third film they will introduce new things.,blackpanthere
The loss of Chadwick Boseman is painfully felt. I feel like Shuri could be better written? I really liked her in previous movies but here... I don't know theres just something off putting here. I really liked Namor but he could be better written too. Riri was here for what reason? Nobody knows. Her costume was terrible CGI garbage. Entertainable and touching movie but I don't see myself watching it again at home on my laptop. On the good side the actress playing the queen acted the hell out of this role!,blackpanthere
"The story lacks cohesion and is far too slowly paced. This didn’t need to be three hours long. Predicable story beats and underdeveloped characters make this a chore to watch. Considering how this is supposed to be such a pivotal chapter due to T’challa’s death, the movie fumbles on the tone it wants to set and has its characters perform asinine actions. This is the marvel formula the audience has been being fed for far too long.",blackpanthere
"It was not great as the first one but it was good. Even though there is no male protagonist, the movie delivered the vibe. Namor was good. Angela Bassett Performance was Oscar worthy. Rest in Power Chadwick Boseman.",blackpanthere
"MID overall, it's just not the same with out Chadwick but I will say it is nice tribute to Chadwick Boseman, Rip to a legend",blackpanthere
"It just reminds me that if there's a fight there must be a reason for it, whether good or bad. Regardless, there must be enough loyal constituents to defend said reason.",blackpanthere
"Avengers: Endgame - at least the first segment of it - was a film about life in the wake of trauma and loss. For such a high-profileBut film it was a boldly meditative, thoughtful way to go ... until the film pressed the Big Reset Button and it turned out that nothing means anything in this world. You can just undo the loss, and the MCU has been struggling ever since. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is also about grief, but for altogether more serious reasons. What was to happen after the tragic loss of the first film's star was an almost impossible decision; I have no doubt this film was made in good faith in regard to that situation. There was no easy route. But the result is a strangely patchy mess, a little of this and a little of that. Some impressive set pieces, an antagonist people whose superpower appears to be singing; on the other hand, some moving stuff and good performances. It's way too long. Way, way too long. Somewhat dull as a result. It was always going to be a hard film to make, and doubtless, the makers deserve a round of applause for getting it done at all. The result, however, is much like the MCU as a whole in recent times: adrift, aimless, devoid of real meaning.",blackpanthere
"Not quite a good action movie, not quite a great story, lazily written enemy and the stupidest military strategy since the Japanese invaded pearls harbour when choosing where to have the final battle. This could have been a much better film with some better writers because the cast all delivered their roles perfectly.",blackpanthere
"The best of phase 4. Tenoch as Namor is the best, he is not a villain, he is an antagonist with true motives. Angela bassett performs to win an oscar. Letitia wright complies but was not fantastic. The movie has quite an interesting plot. Good photography, music and production design. The bad point is Agent Ross and Riri feel forced.",blackpanthere
"I went into the theatre, ready to cry. The grief that was shown among the actors, was too real. It heavily influenced my overall enjoyment of the film, as I knew the actors were going through real moments of grief when they were crying and mourning on screen. I thought it was a beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Wakanda Forever.",blackpanthere
"This movie spits in the face of Chadwick Boseman and dishonors his legacy as Black Panther. It additionally spits in the collective faces of almost all MCU fandom. A waste of a movie and storyline. SKIP IT the only reason it charted was because we expected so much more and got so much less! The only reason this was a ""success"" was because every fan went in hoping for Black Panther 2 and instead we got a weak and sad simulacrum of Black Panther this title should be Black Puma: Because we hate everyone who doesn't look like us, you are all horrible anyway, now give me your money or you are Ra**st!",blackpanthere
"Wow, it really was worse then the first. The tributes to Boseman were sweet and tasteful, but as a movie overall its weak. They had the material for such a better story, but it just ended up being boring. It has little to no momentum, emotionally or in excitement. The movie felt more invested in a mediocre plot rather then spending its efforts on character work which is sparse. I'd say skip it.",blackpanthere
"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever stands out from other Marvel projects by letting us feel our emotions and sympathize with characters without being interrupted by jokes, and the visuals are beautiful. Surprisingly, a lot of the jokes hit.",blackpanthere
"Movie was alright, felt a little too long in my opinion, and I would also like to see a little bit more action throughout the film, overall not bad.",blackpanthere
"I'm a huge Marvel fan so I'm a bit biased but this is very good for an MCU movie. At times it felt that Shuri shouldn't really be the main character not because she's a bad character, or because the actor did badly or whatever, but she was supposed to be a side charecter and just doesn't really fit the spotlight. Still, this was a great movie, and paid excellent tribute to Chadwick Boseman!",blackpanthere
"It's sad to say goodbye to Chadwick both as a person and an actor but I think Marvel did as good of a job as they could to send him off respectfully. However, the movie itself was just boring and overall the plot didn't make much sense. The whole thing just felt like we weren't supposed to question anything. The current phase of Marvel is so disappointing compared with the phases leading up to Infinity War.",blackpanthere
"Minha opinião: Um dos melhores filmes de heróis de 2022, mas não quer dizer que esta entre os melhores da historia. Mais fraco que o 1º, teve o sepultamento de  honrando a sua historia. Mas neste filme há mais um sepultamento. Um filme bem produzido com sua cores e fotografia. Mas os produtores fumaram um belo de um basead0, com a estoria de Namor. Namor na estoria de quadrinhos vem de um relacionamento de uma Atlante e ser humano, acho que para não parecer ser a mesma estoria de quaman Colocaram Namor como um índio asteca, maia,...... que foram contaminados com vibranium. Ficaram azuis e metapeixes. Não sei oque comentar. Então aquele Namor dos quadrinhos se tornou um índio voador e peixe. Piada. A nova Pantera Negra é Lititia, todo aquele ritual para o 1º filme, aqui tudo isso foi ignorado e simplesmente ela se transformou. Uma outra gande gafe do filme e quando Lupita que para descer até o habitat de Namor teve de usar um traje especial por causa da pressão que a mataria, mas quando ela salva a princesa, sobe a superfície sem precisar do traje. Roteiro e enredo realmente a traição para estoria do Namor e como o transformaram, foi sim um ultraje. A forma como levado a batalha no navio, foi patético. Uma hora é um Super criatura, mas depois se tornam lutadores irrisórios. Vale apena assistir? Sim, mas desde que não seja tão critico para não se frustar. Nota: 8 sem ser critico, 6 sendo critico",blackpanthere
"Desde su comienzo, la forma tan abrupta y carente de emoción en la que nos explican la pérdida de T'Challa hace que esta película se sienta desconectada de su predecesora. La introducción del reino de Talokan prometía una buena trama, pero lamentablemente la inexperiencia del director hizo que esa trama esperada no fuera ni la sombra de lo que pudo ser. Por otra parte la película está repleta de fallos propios de amateurs, como los paupérrimos efectos visuales, las vestimentas ridículas (especialmente los trajes insulsos que me hacen recordar a los ""Power Rangers""), el humor en toda la película carece de cualquier gracia, y por último, el desenlace de la película fue extremadamente cliché. Sin duda, un completo desastre! La primera vez que la vi, tuve que retirarme de la sala antes de que acabara porque resultaba realmente desagradable. La segunda vez que la vi, me propuse verla hasta el final y la agonía fue la misma de la primera vez. Una muestra más de que Marvel va cada vez más en declive.",blackpanthere
"An awesome tribute to Chadwick Bozeman, I was worried that Marvel couldn't pull it off without him. In many ways, it was better than the first. The Aztec-Native American look was amazing, the villain was good. Angela Basset got snubbed!",blackpanthere
This film takes its time in the first 2/3rds and i like that but it feels like it might have been a bit too slow as the climax feels rushed.,blackpanthere
schrekliche fortsetzung ..... die ersten 5 minuten sind schön da sie boseman gwidmet sind der rest ..... cgi ist schlecht .... ironman kopie is grauenvoll ..... und im ganzen sehr unstimmig . kein bedarf an teil 3,blackpanthere
"A worthy sequel that gives an entertaining story while paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman, but there are moments that can be seen as underwhelming. Rating: 65%",blackpanthere
"I did not expect this movie to be that great, characters were written amazingly and with much depth in their conflicts. Visually it was so, SO beautiful, the shots, the visual effects, the costumes - all that was just a beauty to watch and I could just do that, but then I would miss the music and sounds which were totally epic as well. This movie is also very rich story-wise and has a clever humor. Overall it's amazing and feels very fresh, which I (not for a first time) thought was impossible, but marvel once again came up with a gem and proved me wrong.",blackpanthere
"Nino sin amor? Namor… what an IDIOTIC explanation. It ruined a really cool way of integrating Maya culture, completely blew it. IronHeart? so, this girl just makes a suit becomes battle ready over night… yawn dont get me started recreating Tony's Iron Man one built scene. this movie sucked…",blackpanthere
Just awful. 3 hours of crying and self-importance. One and a half action scenes. Zero joy or laughter. Reviews are shocking. Haven't met one person who enjoyed this.,blackpanthere
"After Chadwick Boseman's unexpected passing in August 2020, director Ryan Coogler found himself faced with the mammoth task of trying to craft a soulful send off for a true king, while also building off the success and world of 2018's ""Black Panther"". The acclaimed director steps up to the seemingly impossible challenge of trying to make a film without its most integral character, but Coogler manages to exceed expectations, crafting a poignant and thoroughly entertaining film. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" draws out stellar performances from its cast and introduces marvel audiences to new threats these beloved characters face. After King T'Challa's death, Queen Ramonda (Angela Bassett), Shuri (Letitia Wright), and the entire kingdom of Wakanda find themselves mourning their admired leader. But with world powers becoming increasingly frustrated with Wakanada's refusal to share their precious Vibranium, they decide to take matters into their own hands. Their search inadvertently angers Namor, king of an ancient underwater kingdom known as Talokan. Determined to keep his kingdom safe and hidden, Namor asks Wakanda to find the scientist responsible for creating the machine finding the Vibranium. But, as tensions rise between the two nations, will Namor's desire to wage war on the surface world, and keep his kingdom and his people safe, wipe out Wakanda as we know it? Ryan Coogler directs a moving depiction of grief and loss with such tenderness that solidifies him as the perfect man to direct the film. Coogler takes Boseman's absence and builds off of it in such a way that audiences wouldn't think possible, delivering an outstanding sequel to one of last decade's most culturally significant films. ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" manages to escape Marvel's curse of mediocre sequels, majorly surpassing films like ""Thor: The Dark World"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". With its ability to juggle its multiple themes and its duality of being an entertaining action flick with a suitable send off for a king, the film is a strong way to end phase four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Angela Bassett reprises her role as Queen Ramonda and delivers a powerful and vivid performance. Bassett flawlessly proves she deserves the Oscar nomination she received for her performance as the Wakandan queen, and quickly asserts herself one of the highlights of the film. Letitia Wright also delivers a fantastic performance, not only does she shine as Shuri, but the BAFTA nominee also brilliantly steps into the role of Black Panther with ease. Both women do a stellar job encompassing their characters' intense grief and emotion Tenoch Huerta makes his MCU debut in the film, bringing the aquatic character of Namor to the screen. The ""Narcos: Mexico"" actor brings the menacing villain to life with an assured performance that allows Namor to be an ominous new threat while also introducing audiences to a whole new part of the Marvel Universe. Huerta's turn as Namor benefits from Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole's impressive worldbuilding when it comes to the underwater world of Talokan. As well as introducing audiences to a new villain, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" also finally brings the character of Riri Williams (a.k.a Ironheart) into the MCU. Dominique Thorne (""If Beale Street Could Talk"") easily slips into the role as the gifted MIT student, injecting energy into the character even if at times her inclusion seems like a bit of a plot device. Much like its 2018 predecessor, the film features stunning cinematography that brilliantly highlights both the intricacies of the costumes as well as the elaborate sets of Wakanda, while also making the film a visual feast for the eyes. Autumn Durald Arkapaw (""Loki"") crafts stunning imagery that rivals the cinematography of the first film, while also escaping the curse of Marvel's bland cinematography. Ludwig Göransson returns to the world of Black Panther with yet another incredible score. Working his magic once again, the Swedish composer, who won an Oscar for his work on the first Black Panther film, composes a score full of the work of talented African and Latin artists alongside grand classical pieces. Like ""Black Panther"", this film is accompanied by a soundtrack comprised of songs specifically written for the film by a myriad of artists from across the globe. Artists like Stormzy, Future, and Rihanna have their songs included in the film, with the latter writing two songs for the film. As well as being technically impressive, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" also ends up managing its complex themes with remarkable ease. Ryan Coogler weaves ideas of loss, grief, family and legacy into the narrative without allowing them to overpower the film, but including them in the film in such a tasteful way. The film is both an affecting send off for a king, and a stellar instalment in the ever-expanding MCU. In typical Marvel fashion, the film does include the standard mid-credit scene but departs from the tradition of using it to set up a future film or introduce a new villain, instead choosing to carry on the legacy of Boseman's character in a heart-warming and unexpected way. Ryan Coogler directs an outstanding film that manages to thoroughly entertain viewers, while also showcasing a fitting send off to Chadwick Boseman. Despite the hefty runtime, ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is loaded with intense action and heart-breaking emotion that keeps audiences engaged throughout, and sticks with you long after the credits have rolled.",blackpanthere
"Although it is not as good as the original one, we don't really need to compare them that much. It is a heartwarming tribute to Boseman's star role, and this story also feels fresh and it works on its own. As always with this universe, the characters, music, costume designs, visual effects, edition, performances, dialogues and much more elements all work together and create one of the best films that Marvel Studios has delivered recently. The cultural aspect is amazing as well and I enjoyed it profusely.",blackpanthere
"really good; i wasn't overly excited about the sea people per se -- not because of the characters themselves, because they were quite cool, but i felt like their war with Wakanda didn't really make much sense. it did, but it also didn't. idk. however i loved the tribute in the beginning & how they tied things up at the end. it was a necessary installment & they exectued it really really well.",blackpanthere
"Chadwick Boseman became the Black Panther. He welcomed us to Wakanda. Outside, he remained as his character inspiring others. After ""Endgame"", he stood by Kevin Fiege in formally announcing ""Black Panther II"". Then a year later, he has become one within the Ancestral Plane. He was so great in embracing the role he could not be replaced, no matter if there are potential storylines for T'Challa to explore and grow. He owned the role by bringing him to life, and other portrayals afterwards followed his humane lead. We have seen recasts through the MCU, and they carried the characters well despite still missing the original star, but it is not the same on someone so incredibly definitive and personally close to the role till suddenly gone. The show still went on, for a reason to make him proud rather disappoint nor replace him, and ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" became methodically personal, transcending above the MCU like an evolutionary cinematic piece. Chadwick died of colon cancer, only known by very few people being aware of his silent struggle over his final few years as he tackled projects and roles with 110% effort that finalizes his legacy while checking off some sort of bucket list. This real-life loss was integrated into the revised story. Originally, it was about T'Challa's grip on time after being blipped for five years, dealing with the political climate and his role as a father. Now in the given revision that acts as remembrance, Wakanda grieves over the sudden loss of their king that stirs intervening world powers to obtain their ancestrally cherished resources for their gain. With another nation, hidden from the world, threatening to surface war, Queen Ramonda must protect what is left of her family as Shuri is prolonging her grief, while the Wakandans as a whole strive to embrace this next chapter that would forge a new path for their kingdom. They will stand and fight, chanting T'Challa's call: Wakanda Forever! Already acknowledged out of preparation that this experience will differ without Boseman's outstanding energy, this became a very touching spiritual tribute that finely functions as closure on any sort of grief while somewhat. ""Wakanda Forever"" is not only your typical fashion of exceeding expectations, but it also became more than the MCU. To clarify, the interconnected films are mostly great in their own ways, some riveted only to the minimum four stars with questionable lows, as they embrace cinematic roots adjacent to their vast comic mythology while recognized as comic book adaptations. Only three features he directed priorly, storyteller Ryan Coogler continues expanding his craft from grounded ""Fruitvale Station"" to uplifting revival in ""Creed"" to culturally assimilated ""Black Panther"" whereas more topics are involved and thoroughly debated, further provoking thoughts. This is his fourth feature, ranking equally with the predecessor, and he achieved what any director sought through an artistically astonishing film. Uniquely presented, aesthetically distinctive apart from others, this is about a grieving assortment of well-established characters displaying their true strengths from experiencing losses and finding the courage to move on while protecting their nation from another with history under mirrored morality as counter reflection. Thematic communication in the narrative veins not only discusses grief next to family but also talks about power and sanctuary peace – as well empathetic royalty. These discourses became supportive structures in constructing the script under such thoroughness, they were thoughtfully written then remarkably executed as their own arguments with counterarguments fleshed out developmentally, continuing the politicism and switching around the questioned legacies that defined the first film as T'Challa became king. The wisdom he shared since ""Civil War"" is silently referenced under subtexts. If Boseman was still alive, grief would have been swapped with time as the only difference between the possible original vision and the final result. But then we would not have the emotionally difficult conflict that Shuri faces and how she connects with the film's antihero Namor's humanity through her inner struggle of unwillingness to let go. This is one of the two films' strongest elements since Wakanda is a hidden, invaluable nation that is advanced across technology and intelligence carefully treads unlike most others, till their considerable weakness under elitism when keeping outsiders from setting foot inadvertently open the setting to our reality. Hence how they are thematically driven with pivotal ideas spread out. Another elemental prominence that powers the themes is the emotional drive from the powerful performances, which is another bolstering source in its transcendent. As we explore the characters more, particularly both returning and introduced, they evolve towards newfound strength. Angela Basset as Ramonda is not just a mother, Letitia Wright as Shuri is not just a supportive intelligent sister who can fight, Lupita Nyong'o as Nakia is not just a love interest, Danai Gurira as fierce, traditional warrior Okoye is not just a loyal captain, and Winston Duke as M'Baku is not just a rebellious brawn for connective power. They become more, and the cast embrace their respective transformation, or better to describe it as a chance to explore more of their strengths and how to climb back up. They performed exceptionally, while Wright, Basset and Gurira in particular performed at their best when most charged, while one other performance is a satisfying surprise. Wright is the main star as she has been poised to take over the mantle, with reluctance hindered by grief over self-shame of failing to heal her brother (they bonded like true siblings in real life), held the film up with heightened caliber depicting raw emotions through her character's growth. She still has that humorous charm like everyone else, but this film dims more serious considering the stakes and how they pressure them down from fragility to truism. While Wright's performance is heartrending from the start then as an enjoyable presence till she mustered her resonating inner strength outwardly, her filmic mother figure Basset acknowledges her character is on the same boat and personally amplify it with a mesmerizing performance that solidifies the film's overall powerfulness as an emotional staple capably peaked. Her best scene may have been almost entirely glimpsed in the trailer – rightfully predicted towards her coming accolades, but the whole scene has proper buildup and a tearfully strained start. She was striking down on Gurira over a failed mission, and Gurira's keeps a stoic stance with constant fierceness and humor, but that moment broke her and brought out who she is within as a hefty representation for lined warriors.",blackpanthere
"It was similar in quality to the first Black Panther movie, although it obviously loses something without the late Chadwick Boseman. Considering it's a sequel without the title character from the first film, they did a great job at making it entertaining under the circumstances. If you liked the first Black Panther film, you'll probably enjoy this as well.",blackpanthere
"I watched this on its release date, because I was just dying to see how they would be able to make a sequel without Chadwick, and it wasn't so bad. I mean, it wasn't as good as the first one, but I was not bad too. Angela Basset is stunning, she should have won that Oscar, because the dedication put into this character is on another level.",blackpanthere
This movie was cliche and boring. The plot was silly and many of the characters feel awkward and cringe worthy. I’m not sure who the target audience of this film was because it’s far too graphic for children and offers nothing for adult audiences.,blackpanthere
"The film is for one viewing, in some places I even scrolled it. Very loses with the first part. Computer special effects no longer surprise anyone, and the acting is unfortunately standard (",blackpanthere
Wasnt completely terrible but had some big issues. Took an existing character in Namor and made him weird. Why was Martin Freeman even in it? Wasnt Wakanda landlocked? How does the guy with plate in his lip eat? It is a movie that seems to have no consequences and no baring on the MCU. Bit of a grind to get thru.,blackpanthere
Extremely moving memorial they did in the beginning of the movie for Chadwick. The whole theater was silent. They really did an amazing job keeping his legacy alive.,blackpanthere
"I really wanted to love this movie. I'd read all the amazing write ups about it, so my hopes were sky high. But its a case of the emperors new clothes. It was always going to be difficult to walk in the first movies shadow, with the passing of the main star, big shoes to fill etc. I found it all underwhelming and I am so gutted. I guess the beauty of the movies is that you can't please all of the people all of the time. I thought the action was lacklustre, and the story wasn't that great either, i got all the nice messages and sentiments within the film, but it didn't hold my interest like the first movie. It lacked a really good villain too. I really hope marvel aren't losing their way, but I feel fatigued by the MCU at the moment.",blackpanthere
"Buena película, una secuela que cumple y que en mi opinión (ya que no me gusto mucho la primera) supera a la anterior cinta. Ryan Coogler logra hacer una secuela a la altura, el inicio es simplemente perfecto, la película es más una despedida a Chadwick Boseman, de ahí se me hizo muy inteligente que el conflicto interno de los protagonistas se base en la perdida, Shuri con T'Challa y Ramonda, y Namor el vengar la memoria de su mamá. El villano a mi me gusto, creo que tiene una buena motivación y cierra muy bien el personaje al final de la cinta, para mi fue de lo mejor. Por otro lado, cada montaje de la película tiene una obra de producción impresionante, cada escena es un deleite visual que junto a una fotografía con tintes naturistas combinada con una banda sonora perfecta, cada soundtrack te introduce en este mundo, Ludwig Göransson una vez mas demuestra su gran talento. Angela Bassett se roba la película, su impecable forma de extenuar sus sentimientos son los que le dan el peso que necesita esta película para funcionar, los actores son los encargados de navegar junto al espectador en los sentimientos de estos personajes, ellos son los que le dan vida a esta película que a diferencia de otras en la saga en esta se explora el lado mas humano de los mismos, sus propias inseguridades y hasta en su egoísmo, cosa que Letitia Wright y Tenoch Huerta hacen a la perfección. Hay aspectos que no me cerraron, ya que tiene cosas que no logran sentirse naturales, como la sobre exposición del conflicto que es muy notorio en las escenas de Valentina y Everett. Por otro lado, el ritmo es bastante lento y la duración de la cinta no acompaña nada, le sobran bastantes escenas con cosas que se podrían haber resuelto en un tiempo mas corto. Los efectos especiales, sobretodo en el aspecto de Black Panther, en el que ya en la anterior película en las escenas de pelea parece un videojuego. El personaje de Shuri esta vez ya convertida en Black Panther no me gusto tanto, me gustaron mas personajes como Okoye, Ramonda, Iron Heart, o M'Baku por ejemplo. En conclusión, una buena película, me parece muy larga y con un ritmo lento, cosa que no ayuda mucho a la cinta, pero hay cosas como el villano o la historia que cuenta que me gustaron bastante y no me parece que sea una mala cinta. La recomiendo.",blackpanthere

much more boring than the previous movie. Far too many progressive pamphlet topycs that makes the movie seems twice longer than it is. Nothing to do with the great original Black Panther.,blackpanthere
It hurts me as a person of color to say how terrible this movie was. Good visuals for the most part. Terrible plot. And even worse casting of characters. Lol Namor was just a joke.a slightly entertaining waste of 3 hours of your life you will never get back.,blackpanthere
"Ok movie, but way too long. I loved how they honored the character of T'Challa, and the villain was one of the best I've seen in recent Marvel movies, but aside from that, it was a 2 star film. Also, the character of Ironheart is super annoying and unbelievable. In the comics, she steals the Iron Man suit, in the movie she makes her own in a local garage. Really? And MIT is the equivalent of a middle school in Wakanda. Really?",blackpanthere

An excellent and sad follow up to the first one. As we pay our respects to a great actor and a great man Chadwick Boseman. My own issue with the villain of Namor. I don't mean changing his kingdom from Atlantis. I can totally understand that. Since when they appeared in the comics Marvel and DC loved ripping each other off in ways that can't result in lawsuits. Like the name Atlantis is public domain. But today it's still pubic domain but will end up in unflattering comparisons. But my problem is he's basically underwater version of Killmonger. Motive wise. It's a minor nitpick to a marvelous movie.,blackpanthere
"What a hot mess! Plot structure's all over the place and unfortunately, without Chadwick's screen presence and ability. The rest of the top billed cast just can't drag this over the line…",blackpanthere
"When I started watching MCU, I imagined it will be horrible. For teenagers in the lower bracket of mind capacity. It was not so bad - I actually enjoyed it up to Endgame. However, it is now. This is what I expected when I was thinking ""horrible"" - what Wakanda Forever offers us. More of the same, CGI which is good but normal now, broken physics, lame characters, lame dialogue, lame story.",blackpanthere

"I know I am the outlier but Marvel movies are bland and repetitive. This is no exception. The plot is nonsensical, the characters motivations are confusing and if you want CGI action sequences a video game is more intriguing",blackpanthere
"Either Wakanda is whacked, or I'm just beyond tired of these comic-book super-hero type movies. giving it 3 RT stars, for me 'meh, it just passed the time' Saw it 'lerton AMC, 11.11.22",blackpanthere
"Obviously there is a big hole where Boseman used to be which is tough to get around, but the supporting cast helps pick up the slack. I found Shuri's character a bit grating in the original, but liked her much better here. Namor is an excellent addition to the MCU and I look forward to seeing more of him.",blackpanthere
"Esta secuela me encanto y es una de las mejores películas del 2022. La forma en que Suri pasa por una etapa difícil por la muerte de su hermano T'Chala y la triste historia de origen de Namor están bien escrita y tiene mas argumento en comparación con las entregas anteriores de Marvel. Puede llegar a ser larga y pesada, pero eso no cambia el hecho de que tiene una muy buena historia. Buenas escenas de acción y efectos, una banda sonora estilo nativo y la forma en que los mayas fueron proyectados, la verdad no le veo falla alguna a esta película. Bastante recomendable y la calificare con un 10/10.",blackpanthere
"Angela Bassett carries, Namor is an amazing villain with believable motivation and brutal effects on the protagonists. A wonderful love letter to Chadwick Boseman and you can tell this is a movie that the creators WANTED to make, opposed to a lot of the stuff in Phase 4.",blackpanthere
An absolute masterpiece by Ryan Coogler. I was in tears multiple times. The plot was solid and Namor was really cool. I hope we get to see more of the political tensions between the US and Wakanda/Talokan in the future.,blackpanthere
"Emotionally action packed experience that pays a fine tribute to a beloved actor, and makes the transition work well onward into the new era of Wakanda where women rule.",blackpanthere
"saw it opening night and what a great film, loved what they did with the characters, great action. feels like a small reboot but had to be done, want more M'Baku.Naymor was amazing and terrifying, the queen was powerfull.

"Fake ironman typische wir stecken Frauen in alte Rollen weil wir zu faul sind ihnen etwas eigenes aufzubauen Szenario. Alle Interessanten Charaktere Tot und nur noch Teenager am rum lungern. Storyline einfältig und nicht spannend. Das einzige was den Film oben hält sind die ziemlich coolen Kriegerinnen die seit ihrem ersten Auftreten 100% Badass sind. Bösewicht ist Schmutz. Nach Bosemans Tot hätte man den Black Panther beenden sollen und etwas neues aufbauen müssen, aber der bringt so viel Umsatz das man sich keine Mühe geben muss und die Leute ja eh mittlerweile alles Fressen was sie kriegen.",blackpanthere
"More rubbish from Marvel. Apart from Spider-Man they have made a load of absolute dross recently and this is no different. God almighty but this is a tedious film. A clown show of a film. Did they watch the crap that was Aquaman and get inspired? I'm sure they think they are being clever and imparting some meaningful message, but I grew too bored to care what it is. Exceptionally bad film.",blackpanthere
"There is something strange going on here, just looking reviews they are overwhelming negative yet RT is showing a 94% approval? Calling BS As for my review: Too long, rambles pointlessly and boring, even my teenage son fell asleep.",blackpanthere
"Much of the movie was filmed very dark and hard to see. Also many subtitles which were distracting and did not add to the movie. There was a fairly depressing nature to the movie in general. The second half was much better than the first. It was OK, but not particularly inspiring or uplifting. Acting was good as well as the nature of the characters, but overall bits of the story missed for me.",blackpanthere
"Le film est super ! Les effets visuels sont incroyables, les décors et les costumes sont magnifiques. Le film est très long mais le scénario est bien pensée et bien écrit. C'est un bel hommage à Chadwik Boseman. WAKANDA FOREVER !",blackpanthere
"I watched this with my 7 year-old son. He stopped watching after 10 minutes. I stopped watching after 40 minutes. One of the most mixed up, slowest films I've ever seen half of. Rubbish.",blackpanthere
"Angela Bassett gives a strong performance as the doomed queen, but the movie, despite all it's hype, is nothing but another Marvel superhero movies with little to offer other outside of equity,",blackpanthere
Great movie to watch! I love angela Bassett. She is such a good actress. They were really truly respectful of Chadwick Bosnian while developing the new storyline. Well done. Loved it!,blackpanthere
"The first half is very slow and, truth be told, boring. I didn't find any characters compelling enough to relate to and the action was minimal. The last half was watchable, but hardly exciting. On the whole, this comic book movie took itself way too seriously.",blackpanthere
"One of the worst written Marvel movies ever, the acting is bland at Best, with awful rithm, and not very high end CGI, it entertains , but is not a good film altogether",blackpanthere
"The final scene with the antagonist helped to rescue the film. Before that scene, it felt like just a one off movie that really did not help with continuity of the universe. Fun action flick and proper homage to a passed actor.",blackpanthere
"In my opinion, it’s the best movie I have ever seen so far in my life. Its ability to portray the nature of war is unparalleled to anything I have ever seen. Brutal, visceral and raw this movie has all the components necessary for a spectacular war epic.",fullmetaljacket
"The most I can describe it as is an absolute masterpiece. I understand where some of the negativity comes from, and the movie is definitely not perfect but I genuinely could not look away from the screen when watching. The portrayal of war in this movie genuinely shocks me in the same way Saving Private Ryan did, both of them being great movies. If you ever get the chance to, please go watch this movie.",fullmetaljacket
Although one could see were the negative comments about this come from I think this movie shows very intensive how the war changes each psyche. And with a wonderful image quality.,fullmetaljacket
"This is a great, great Stanley Kubrick film. I first act of the film is the strongest, which some might consider a flaw. Vincent D'Onofrio really knocked it out of the park as Private Pile in what is quite possibly his career best performance. Before he got this role, he had gotten himself in the best shape of his life only to be offered a part in a Stanley Kubrick film, which was a dream for any actor in the world while Mr. Kubrick was still making films. He gained some 40 pounds only for Stanley to tell him that he just looks ""like he could kick everybody's ass here"". That meant he had to gain another 30 pounds to look like the pathetic Private Pile that Kubrick had in mind. He gained the weight, got the part, and the rest is history! Lee Ermey was born to play Gunnery Sergeant L. Hartman. He, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Matthew Modine absolutely owned the opening scene. Modine was exceptional in his role as Private Joker. Full Metal Jacket being a 1980s Vietnam War film, the comparisons to Platoon are inevitable. Oliver Stone's Platoon came out in 1986, and I consider it to be a masterpiece. Personally, I think it is the better film of the two, but Full Metal Jacket is certainly the more well-made, more professionally crafted film. Any critic can see the master at work in the finer details of the picture. Of course, Oliver Stone is a great filmmaker in his own right, but I'm sure even he would admit that Stanley Kubrick was the best or one of the top 2 or 3 in the history of cinema. I love Joker's thousand yards stare at the end of the movie. The film ends on an analytical note, appropriate for a combat correspondent. I most definitely recommend it. 94/100",fullmetaljacket
"Be prepared for non stop shock. A disguised tragic comedy for the first half. Depicts all three sides in the Vietnam War in a very poor light. How about the men who made it happen? This was mostly Johnson's and, to a lesser extent, McNamara's war. The acting and cinematography is top notch. A well crafted disaster.",fullmetaljacket
"The complete absence of a plot, the many scenes that were just there for shock value, and the terrible acting all add up to a very unimpressive movie.",fullmetaljacket
"The first 30 minutes 9/10 the rest 3/10 dull, dry, boring the protagonist is an empty shell of a man and everyone else in it is a stupid moron",fullmetaljacket
"A film in two halves and the first half, although exploring a very familiar theme, is the better. There, I've said it. The central Joker character is little more than a frippery, but R Lee Ermey's drill instructor is very believable (and vile). Other characters come and go, but Vincent D'Onofrio's Leonard is spellbinding. Two stars for him alone.",fullmetaljacket
"R Lee Ermey is the absolute impersonation of a real period correct drill sergeant in the most convincing portrayal you're likely to see in a movie, perhaps because he really was a real marine drill sergeant? Portrays the vision Kubrick had perfectly. Twisted and irrational as it should be, great stuff",fullmetaljacket
I have seen this movie countless times it’s one of my absolute favorite Vietnam war movies. I want to watch it again tonight with my daughter. I like to share with people that I love.,fullmetaljacket
"This movie is a mess. It tells more than one story rather than one whole entire story. Nothing feels connected, nor does anything work. After the first half, the movie becomes more of a mess. The two main characters aren't present, which makes you wonder who really are the main characters.",fullmetaljacket
I don’t think there’s much that can be said about this movie other than it’s an entertaining movie that you can rewatch and still enjoy. With many notable moments that you can look back on.,fullmetaljacket
"A fantastic satire of the Vietnam War that's hilarious in the first half and harrowing in the second half. R Lee Ermey is legendary as the belligerent drill sergeant. He easily steals the show. He's hilarious and terrifying at the same time with his cartoonist intensity. Every line he says is super quotable and it's no wonder he was a former drill sergeant in real life. The first half is definitely better than the second, but the second half is still bittersweet enough to make this a classic in my book.",fullmetaljacket
"FMJ follows the Dirty Dozen approach to war films by beginning with the training of ""useless maggots"" into killer marines. Entertaining though this is, the momentum & focus is quickly dissipated by a ""Good Morning Vietnam"" interlude before the war action finally arrives. Whilst illustrating the seeming futility & lack of clear military purpose of the Vietnam war may have been one of the director's key purposes, it doesn't make for particularly rivetting viewing until the last 20 minutes of the film when the on-screen tension & brooding industrial soundtrack combine to at least send us all home relatively satisfied by the overall cinematic experience.",fullmetaljacket
A disturbing film at the beginning. Once they got to Vietnam I liked the movie better. Stanley Kubrick is a great director. I like the soundtrack to this film.,fullmetaljacket
"Unpopular opinion, but I actually prefer the Vietnam half better than the basic training half. Either way, both parts of the film are absolutely amazing. R. Lee Ermy did an excellent job of portraying the Drill Sargeant.",fullmetaljacket
"A tentativa de Stanley Kubrick de fazer um filme sobre a guerra do Vietname é bastante singular. Ao invés de se focar tanto na guerra em si, o filme explora a influência que a guerra tem no psicológico das pessoas. Isto, combinado com a narração de certo modo jornalística do protagonista, fazem deste um fantástico filme do género.",fullmetaljacket
"The first half of this movie is amazing! Ermey and D’Onofrio carry the movie even though they’re only in it for half the movie, with the brutality of the training, and Private Pyle descending into a mental instability. The 2nd half of the movie is nothing to write home about, but that 1st half more than makes up for it",fullmetaljacket
"An amazingly well done war film, the two parts are both great on their own, especially the first, but the main flaw is their lack of connection which can make the film seem quite pointless.",fullmetaljacket
Stanley Kubrick’s take on the Vietnam War stars a lot of great actors and even a real life drill sergeant aka (R. Lee Ermey) overall a very gritty and chilling movie that deserves a 10/10,fullmetaljacket
"Two different movies in one film. The basic training part was completely fascinating and incredibly well-done. The actual war part was pretty standard, but well-paced and well-directed. Just an unavoidable let-down from the state-side portion of the film.",fullmetaljacket
"I had not seen it in years, and what had always stood out to me most was the boot camp saga, perhaps for what it is most remembered, spanning 45 minutes or so. To be sure, it may still ring to me as the most prolific piece of the film, D'Onofrio potent and believable. However, the true story arch was always centered on Joker. The film is much more complete and powerful when honing in on his journey, an intellectual saddled with more empathy than an infantryman might like, he can see through the BS, but is he ultimately capable of harnessing the most primal of actions when a higher understanding demands it in the name of both mercy and necessity? The question looms as to Private Pyle, and it looms at the artful and suspenseful ending...",fullmetaljacket
"Stanley Kubrick did not hold back in any form or fashion. Imagine seeing this as a fifth grader in the 80's, I was more terrified than watching the Shining.",fullmetaljacket
"A painfully accurate depiction of the Vietnam War, with all of its controversies and misjudgements. Not Kubrick's best, as I did find the latter half a little on the slow side; but the messaging underneath it all is a powerful one, and to see Joker slip back into the regimented, robotic nature that he had been trying to forget since Pyle's situation is quite heartbreaking. Though, in terms of pure action, not much to sink your teeth into, which again may be something done on purpose.",fullmetaljacket
"War is not fighting for the good of humanity, but fighting with the lack of humanity! As the Vietnam War rages, we are taken to the training regiment that prepares them for the conflict and the battleground where it's fought, which makes it hard to tell which one is more brutal. Savage is the name of the game in this film, and the game is one where no one wins!",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket is dark, gritty, and in your face. This is an unforgiving film which delivers a beautiful masterpiece both with the visuals and performances. Kubrick really knew how to craft a film and Full Metal Jacket is another great example of this. As the years went on after it's initial release it became more of a cult classic. Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, and R. Lee Ermey really bring powerful performances here that will stick with you long after you watched this movie. Now note this is not your typical war film and focuses more on character development rather then action. Full Metal Jacket gets a perfect 5 stars out of 5 from me.",fullmetaljacket
"Muy buena película, una icónica cinta bélica de acción. Esta es una película que se me hizo muy entretenida, lo cual es raro ya que me suelen aburrir un poco las películas de guerra, pero esta se me paso rápido sobretodo en sus primeros 45 minutos. Este primer acto es excelente y se me hace muy superior a todo lo demás, ya que se nos muestra el entrenamiento de unos soldados y como son explotados por su sargento hasta que uno cae en la locura; es un acto genial que te genera muchas cosas. Por otro lado, la otra parte de la película en la que ya es la guerra es un poco mas lenta y no se me paso tan rápido como lo anterior pero si me gusto mucho, aunque quizás es porque ya venia de ver el primer acto que esta a un nivel muy alto y esperaba algo parecido. También hay que destacar las actuaciones que son geniales, principalmente las de R. Lee Ermey, Matthew Modine y Vincent D'Onofrio; estos tres actores están a un nivel muy alto y brindan una actuación fantástica. En conclusión, una muy buena película de guerra que tiene un primer acto excelente y con un nivel muy por encima de todo lo que pasa después, pero que en general es una gran cinta que todo cinéfilo debería ver. La recomiendo.",fullmetaljacket
"Has anyone actually finished this film? Understandable if you haven't. The first half made such a significant impact that hardly anyone refers to the second half of the film. Rightfully so, considering how often R. Lee Ermey's legendary performance as Gny. Sgt. Hartman is quoted and referenced. Ironically, he wasn't even cast in the role when he earned the spot. Talk about manifesting your own destiny. Tim Colceri, the original actor hired to portray Hartman, still got his oft-quoted line in the movie though. ""GET SOME!!"" I would also be remiss if I didn't mention Vincent D'Onofrio's haunting performance as Private Pyle culminating in a scene so disturbing that I feel it's a right of passage for most cinephiles.",fullmetaljacket
"This film truly represents a mix of what made Stanley Kubrick a masterclass filmmaker and what he can't seem to get a grip of. 'Full Metal Jacket' is not bad by any means, it just feels inconsistent between the two parts it consists of. The first part, being the military training, is wildly entertaining, hilarious, and yet somber and concluded on a truly depraved note. The second part, being the meat of battle and combat, seems to lag and go for a bit too long (although still very thoughtful). It feels like Stanley is making two different films, one that works and one that exemplifies some of his flaws as a storyteller.",fullmetaljacket
"The conventional wisdom, that the boot camp section is great while the combat scenes are disappointing, fails to recognize how well the two halves of the movie mirror each other in both violent and sexual imagery.",fullmetaljacket
"Overall this is a great movie. Great acting, directing and writing. My only warning is you better not get triggered by people saying a mixture of slurs especially white people saying the Nword. If you can get past that then you're in for a treat. Kubrick is like Tarantino at points slow but everything has been thought through and is included for a reason and will build to really tense and high highs! I'd recommend this one for sure!",fullmetaljacket
"The war drama film, ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), directed by Stanley Kubrick is split into two parts. The first half follows U.S. Marines recruits as they train in a boot camp located in South Carolina and focuses on two privates nicknamed ""Joker"" and ""Pyle"" played by Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio, respectively. The film then switches to American soldiers including Joker as they actively fight in the Vietnam War. A crucial and captivating aspect of the film is the acting. Matthew Modine's portrayal of Joker as a quick-witted and morally grey character grounds the film and even helps balance the small bits of comedy with the harsh representation of war. Modine is skillful as he is able to switch from the squad's class clown to a serious Marine, who is fighting to stay alive while keeping his morals in check. Modine's best scene, in my opinion, is near the end revolving around the sniper. Just through his face alone, you can tell that Joker is going through a variety of thoughts and emotions as he's struggling with a hard choice to make. After doing so, his expression changes to capture the pain of war and how Joker has finally felt the true meaning of it. Another standout in the film is Vincent D'Onofrio as Pyle. Pyle is a slow-minded recruit but is also one of the more interesting and complex characters present in the film. In one of the more powerful and dramatic scenes in the whole movie which closes the first part, D'Onofrio shines as Pyle reaches a breaking point and chooses to fight back against his mistreatment, despite choosing the wrong way to go about it. It is a difficult one to watch thanks to D'Onofrio as the audience can empathize with him and what he goes through but at the same time, doesn't want him to go down the wrong path. You can feel Pyle's emotions boiling up to the surface through D'Onofrio's facial expressions and line delivery which drives home the uncomfortableness of the scene. As someone who doesn't really enjoy war movies, this one was no different. Although there were many parts of the film that interested me such as splitting it into two parts and the well-written characters, it was enough to win me over. I don't see myself recommending this movie to young viewers like myself as it was definitely a difficult watch from start to finish. However, it can be a good movie to watch for those interested in filmmaking and films in general as the writing and acting were the strongest parts in my opinion. I doubt I'll ever rewatch it again as it just wasn't for me. Overall, I would rate ""Full Metal Jacket"" 3.5/5 stars.",fullmetaljacket
"To mention this movie and The Deer Hunter, Casualties of War, or Platoon in the same sentence is shameful. The one-star is for D'Onofrio's performance. Ermey's character was over the top, bordering on comedic. The movie was boring overall and none of the characters were even remotely endearing or interesting. I'm flabbergasted this movie has garnered such good reviews. Full Metal Jacket is greatly overrated. It took me 35 years to watch it and that was 35 years too soon.",fullmetaljacket
From watching it when it first came out to still enjoying it to this day I have to admit it has always been an absolute favorite movie of mine. The actors were great & direction given to them was spot on & couldn't have been done any better. Beginning to end this movie will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. 10+++ EXCELLENT,fullmetaljacket
"A little bit awkward with its pacing and overall sense of story, but it is hauntingly beautiful and troubling. A deep look into the vulnerability of humanity.",fullmetaljacket
"Kubrick has created a virtuous war movie. His signature style is on full display. The plot revolves around the Vietnam War and follows recruits through basic training and ultimately into war. During basic training we see the most iconic Drill Sergeant ever to appear on film preparing and molding his recruits for war. He is also trying to weed out the weak for their own good. He finds his target and then unleashes the most horrific psychological and physical torment ever portrayed on film. It is very difficult to view without feeling remorse for the target and respect for the Drill Sergeant. After basic training the plot follows the main character nicknamed Joker which is appropriate. Joker understands the duplicity of man and the absurdity of war. He is sent into war as a journalist but in the end becomes a product of the violence and environment he is submerged in. The platoon marches away from the battlefield singing in unison a song which this viewer believes Kubrick shot in order to convey his commentary on war and violence. The plot is dark, gritty, disturbing, violent and horrifying. This film has so many unforgettable scenes and dialogue. You'll hear fans quote famous lines such as, "" Let me see your war face."" to this day. FMJ is one of the most unique and insightful movies in it's genre.",fullmetaljacket
"I think what Full Metal Jacket intends is far better than what it actually is. It wears its themes on its sleeve and while the idea of showing the military brainwashing and dehumanization tactics in basic training that lead to broken people with guns leading a death parade in a country they know nothing about is fantastic, it only executes upon a percentage of this. The first half of the movie is intriguing with stellar performances and is iconic for a reason, but when the story transitions to Vietnam, it's frankly awful having to watch these guys ""do war."" They are disorganized, immature, selfish, and lacking humanity. Of course, in part it being awful to watch is the point. But moreover, the movie itself becomes disorganized and lacking humanity as well. It feels like a series of short stories with some being much more effective than others bookended by a random terrible narrator desperately hoping to pull it altogether. FMJ is ultimately interesting as it pulls off its darkly ironic tone. It's a story of men who don't know who they are, what they want, or how even how to be human. Are they to blame? Is the military to blame? The movie doesn't outright tell us, but it strongly suggests there's plenty of blame to go around.",fullmetaljacket
"A bipolar movie if there ever was one, the first half of this movie a masterpiece of storytelling, depicting life in Marine Boot Camp in the Carolinas, circa 1967. R Lee Ermey gives a career defining performance as the slightly off center DI Gunney; he should have at least been nominated that year, if not winning the Academy Award outright for best supporting actor. The second half of the movie, set in NAM during the onset of TET, was surprisingly ordinary, especially when compared to the rousing first half, although it begins promisingly enough with the half French, half Vietnamese hooker, immortalizing Me Love You Long Time to the tune of Nancy Sinatra's BOOTS. Since most of the NAM scenes take place in Saigon, Kubrick missed a golden opportunity to accentuate the urban inter-social elements, instead of the rather mundane battle sequences I suppose he was preprogrammed to follow from a book standpoint (never read it). 4.5 Stars though, for the unforgettable first half, and the promise of what could have been.",fullmetaljacket
A brutal and at times confronting take on a popular subject and brilliantly done at that. Some amazing performances and a tight screenplay gives us one of 1987's best movies.,fullmetaljacket
"Okay, so I'm going to review a film that my friends really liked over the years and that movie is Full Metal Jacket. I love this film for some reason why I love it because it's directed by Stanley Kubrick. I love the opening, that made me laugh and my friend Jacob seen it before and Joshua. And also I love the scene where Private Pyle doesn't lock his foot locker and Gunnery Sergant Hartman finds a jelly donut in the foot locker and the part where Sergant Hartman tells Private Pyle to put the weapon away and Pyle shoot Sergant Hartman and committed suicide. God bless this movie to all my friends.",fullmetaljacket
"Shots of the portrayals of the Vietnam War are remarkable, Vincent D'Onofrio is impressive and language is used that probably provides a fairly realistic portrayal of training to be a U.S. marine for the war. An interview montage also provides important social commentary on the war.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket is masterfully knitted with a thick thread of dark tension, almost horror-like suspense, and intriguing character development. The film does an incredible job of expressing the aimlessness and sickening reality of the Vietnam War while staying true to what soldiers really did and creating a suspenseful storyline. The boot camp part of the film is particularly engaging. Vincent D'Onofrio is chilling and Kubrick is excellent. The best part, however, is the outstanding cinematography from start to finish.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket is a cinematic masterpiece that stands the test of time as one of the most iconic war films in history. Directed by the legendary Stanley Kubrick, this film explores the dehumanizing effects of war on soldiers, through the lens of the Vietnam War. The film is split into two distinct parts - the first follows a group of young Marine recruits as they undergo intense training under the watchful eye of the merciless Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, played brilliantly by R. Lee Ermey. This segment is a tour de force of filmmaking, with Ermey's commanding presence and the intense physicality of the training exercises creating an unforgettable and often unsettling experience for the viewer. The second half of the film follows the same group of soldiers as they are deployed to Vietnam, and here Kubrick expertly conveys the chaos and horror of war. The scenes of combat are visceral and intense, with Kubrick's signature long takes immersing the viewer in the action. The standout performance in this segment comes from Vincent D'Onofrio, who plays the troubled and ultimately tragic Private Pyle with an eerie intensity. Full Metal Jacket is a film that is not afraid to confront the darker aspects of war and the human psyche. It's a powerful and thought-provoking work that continues to captivate audiences decades after its initial release. From the iconic ""This is my rifle"" scene to the haunting closing shot, every moment of this film is a testament to Kubrick's masterful storytelling and filmmaking skills.",fullmetaljacket
Gunnery Sergeant Hartman the Drill Instructor completely steals the show. A performance that's so remarkable and memorable it has you withdrawn once he's out of the picture.,fullmetaljacket
"Full metal jacket tiene un cómico y entretenido primer acto gracias a las ironías ,burlas ,chistes etc que suceden en el entrenamiento militar algo que en si es difícil saber que fue así el trato pero que entretiene ,luego el tono da un gran giro cambiando esto en el comienzo del segundo acto con drama y oscuridad que muestra los posibles daños mentales a una persona con un trato inhumano algo que plasma de manera atemorizante vincent d´onofrio una gran actuación sin dudas ,el resto del segundo y tercer acto se enfoca en lo que fue la guerra de Vietnam y lo que es en general las guerras ,batallas sin sentido que solo traen muerte donde inocentes ,niños ,mujeres y hombres llegan a ser asesinados o corrompidos ,una historia con un gran trasfondo junto a increíbles actuaciones y un guion oscuro e irónico.",fullmetaljacket
"Never have 2 hours felt so short. Kubrick masterfully tells two stories in one film; one of the dehumanization soldiers go through, and one of the realities of war, and it's the shocking speed at which these two stories flow into each other that makes the viewer also realize that a boot camp is far from the real thing. Amazing sets, some quality cinematography and great acting pull it all together. Sure, this movie doesn't do anything new or have a very interesting message, but it's rock solid all around otherwise.",fullmetaljacket
"Really enjoyed the first half of the movie. It was definitely great for its time, but the second half of the movie was completely different than the first half, and felt very similar to other war movies. Still good though, just wish the first half of the movie was capitalized on more.",fullmetaljacket
"Certain happenings could have benefitted from a more lingering effect, but Full Metal Jacket is a visceral, immersive and brutal analysis of the dehumanizing effects war and mental overload has on humans and also sees Kubrick use a lot of his trademark conventions and dark thrills to masterful result.",fullmetaljacket
"Had to watch this for History and WOW, the performances are awesome of everyone. These locations man and the cinematography and that all without visual effects, thats mental to me. The story was fine for me, it didnt really impress me because i have seen stories like this before, but honestly this is one of the first in its kind, so i cant blame the movie for that. The screenplay was really good and i have nothing to add to that. Its not really my kinda movie, but i really appreciate the filmmaking behind this whole movie, because it is mind blowing for 1987. That war sequence, heads of for the location scouts and the set designers, pfff.",fullmetaljacket
First Half of the Film is one of the greatest first half's of any war film ever made. Second half is good but nowhere near as strong as the first. A Classic War Movie still. Anyone who is a fan of the genre or fan of any actors involved should give this a watch.,fullmetaljacket
"Stanley Kubrick fanatics have debated what is Kubrick's greatest film. Spartacus? Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb? 2001: A Space Odyssey? A Clockwork Orange? The Shining? None of them. The true greatest work of art by Stanley Kubrick is Full Metal Jacket. His take on the Vietnam War gives us a joker (Matthew Modine) and his life in the military during the Vietnam War. To start things off, the film's acting is spectacular. The performances from Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, and especially R. Lee Ermey are all fantastic. R. Lee Ermey especially simply because he does a great job and gives us a memorable performance as the no nonsense drill sergeant. The music throughout the entire film fits the Vietnam War theme. Last but not least, the cinematography is nuanced throughout the entire film especially during the film's climax. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is intense, artistic, and even darkly comedic. The way Stanley Kubrick made the film is so perfect.",fullmetaljacket
"Great acting. But I didn't watch this at the time it came out for the same reason I could only give it 3 stars now. It's preaching to the converted, with blood everywhere.",fullmetaljacket
"Stanley Kubrick had such a storied carrier as a filmmaker and he is one of the few that could do any genre well. This is no exception. This is, essentially, two films about Vietnam tied together for one masterful tale. The first half involved boot camp and contains some of the most iconic and copied scenes ever to hit the scene. R. Lee Ermey's portrayal of the drill sergeant is iconic and copied but never equalled. Vincent Donofrio's portrayal of Private ""Pyle"" is not only the best of his career, but among the best you will see. The second half of the movie is a look at the front lines from the perspective of Matthew Modine's character. This is among the most dark and realistic portrayal of war ever filmed. Kubrick's Direction and cinematography make this hard to watch at times, but worth the investment.",fullmetaljacket
"While it may not be one of Stanley Kubrick's best films, Full Metal Jacket is distinctly a Kubrick film. The takes are long and filled with lengthy tracking shots, slow zooms and methodical pans, all traits of his later work. Dealing with the devastating dehumanization of war on its participants, the film is essentially told in two parts – Marine basic training followed by combat in Vietnam. The first portion features powerful performances by R. Lee Ermey as the sadistic Sergeant Hartman and Vincent D'Onofrio as the object of Hartman's abuse while the second half deals with Private Joker (Matthew Modine), a Marine journalist covering the war at the time of the Tet Offensive. Where does the film falter? Not for one second does the film look or feel like Vietnam, despite the dying palm trees spread around the shooting locations. As well, the soundtrack (Chapel of Love, Wooly Bully, Surfin' Bird, etc.) is totally out of place and wince-worthy. All in all, it's a decent movie – just not decent by Kubrick's standards.",fullmetaljacket
"Hilarious movie, and still plenty serious. Balanced that line pretty well. Leonard's character felt a little too exaggerated. I don't understand how someone like that can last as long as he did in basic without being discharged. For example, he clearly wasn't passing the fitness tests (or at the very least he barely was). Very enjoyable overall aside from a few plot points.",fullmetaljacket
"Kubrick's Follow up Film From The Shining Full Metal Jacket Offers Viewers Something Different From the War Film Genre from Explosive Violence it Offers how the Character's Get their where they are Ready for the War, a Madness endure from being a harmless to a violent world of Madness where the characters like the madness they enter but that's my view into the film the first act looks into the Boot camp of two Soldiers Nicknamed Joker and Pyle who Prepare to enter Vietnam for war while Both Struggle from the None Stop Abuse from Their Drill instructor and the later half focusing on the their own struggle in the war zone they enter overall the film is tension and unlike any war film I've seen where Kubrick Slowly Building up its story and Characters but i found the Films ending to Be A Let down and undercooked",fullmetaljacket
"Spoilers without context: - jelly doughnuts - SIR YES SIR - soap - mickey mouse clubhouse! I will be completely honest. My ratings for Full Metal Jacket went up and down like a rollercoaster ride while viewing. It started as a 4 ; then going up to a 5 to only later drop to a 4.5; the 4.5 became a 3 but don't panic! My rating ended in a 4.5. I still cannot decipher why I cannot give it a full 5 but forget numbers. Full Metal Jacket is officially in the top 5 of Kubrick films. War films are nothing new but it's how you make something repetitive look new where you find cinema. He captures the dehumanization of a man in war. Every scene has an important message and we see a blend of cynical humor, (surprisingly) heart, and disaster all in one. Full Metal Jacket does a full damn circle. Raftman begins timid, not really getting in on the war action until the end when he kills the sniper. He yells loud and proud with curse words how happy he is for murdering the enemy. Joker expresses his desire to shoot a gun at an early age yet he's conflictive thoughout the film, whether it's not wanting to join in on the soap-beating of Private Pyle or leaving the sniper to die on her own. Animal is known as this rock with zero f**ks, a killing machine yet we almost see this as a facade of a man who is suffering on the inside from the war and whether or not he shows it, there's still some human in him. Pyle is an interesting character. We experience the slow destruction of a human finishing in the climatic bathroom scene. It's the ending for me. One can't help but chuckle to soldiers marching by burning buildings while singing a Mickey Mouse chant. But, the laughter is short because it is actually chilling. These men still are ""kids,"" who went into a controversial and unnecessary war extremely soon in their lives and in the process lost a huge chunk of their being, yet there is still a tiny percentage of childhood left in them. Talk about an ending. Also, one can't help but hear Gunnery Sergeant's Hartman voice saying, ""What is this Mickey Mouse horseshit?! ""In short, I'm in a world of shit yes, but I am alive and I'm not afraid.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket is locked and loaded from the opening scene. Like the marines to be you dive head first into the angry barrage of insults hurled from the mouth of a true drill sergeant R Lee Ermey. Like the Great War movies alike the story isn't so much about the war but how the human lives in and around the war are effected by it. If this movie had a personality it would hum to the tune of ""War"" by Edwin Starr.",fullmetaljacket
"One of Kubrick's later films, I really consider this film his best attempt to portray the ramifications of war since his early Paths of Glory. The plot of the film follows American soldiers from their first time army train camps to their horrifying experiences in the Vietnam war. The film is distinctively divided in two parts, the first, where we are presented the difficul times of some soldiers named Gomer Pyle, Joker, Animal Mother etc. in an army camp, and their training by psychotic Gunnery Seargant Hartman (R.L. Ermey, in what I believe to be one of the greatest acting achievements in film and some of the best character acting on the screen, I cannot get enough of him) up until the murder of Hartman by Gomer Pyle, who lost his mind after incessant bullying by his peer and harsh training, and the latter's suicide. Up until the ending of the first part, the film maintained a rather dark comical tone, with some harrowing moments, but overall excellent improv by Ermey. The second part of the film follows the soldiers in an attempt to fight off Vietnamese troops, and despite losing friends, they manage to clear the area, but with serious casualties, such as their mental health (important to note that the camera always follows Private Joker and the repercussions war has had on him). The characteristic ending follows the soldiers in a burning landscape marching to their base while singing the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse song, quite ironic, innit. I have nothing but praise for everything, from the carefully adapted screenplay that takes a rather cliche story and elevates it to a whole new level, to technical achievements such as cinematography, art direction, editing and art direction, the sigature Kubrick direction and amazing work from the cast. Only complaint is that after the end of the first part, the tone of the film shifts so suddenly that it takes a while to get used to it, it just feels like the two parts are two different movies. But overall, great film, possibly one of the most darkly comical, harrowing, hard hitting, best examples of war cinema to come out in the 80s. YOU LITTLE SCUMBAG, I GOT YOUR NAME, I GOT YOUR ",fullmetaljacket
"Dark, disturbing, mind-numbingly violent and thought-provoking, with some particularly unforgettable scenes. That being said, there is something messy about it, and it doesn't hold a candle to some of Kubrick's other films. The ending is quite unsatisfactory.",fullmetaljacket
"Never have 2 hours felt so short. Kubrick masterfully tells two stories in one film; one of the dehumanization soldiers go through, and one of the realities of war, and it's the shocking speed at which these two stories flow into each other that makes the viewer also realize that a boot camp is far from the real thing. Amazing sets, some quality cinematography and great acting pull it all together. Sure, this movie doesn't do anything new or have a very interesting message, but it's rock solid all around otherwise.",fullmetaljacket
Really good movie. My only complaint is that the first part of the movie feels a little bit unnecessary a0nd it drags on for too long don't get my wrong it was a good part just a bit odd.,fullmetaljacket
"R. Lee Ermey absolutely kills this first act yet again, delivering banger after banger in his maniacal deconstruction of the unit, and especially D""Onofrio. The emotions I feel while watching his insane behavior so vigorously accepted as ""normal"" by his cadets varies from absurd hilarity, to rage, and then to sadness, among others. There are some stunning shots in the second half which Kubrick gives a totally different look and feel, while sacrificing none of the emotional impact. The final scenes of the unit moving through the fire bombed city of Hue came to mind while watching the portrayal of Ecoust at night in Mendes and Deakins' 1917, as both are equally breathtaking in both their beauty and portrayal of destruction.",fullmetaljacket
"It's one superb movie through the 45-minute first act and it follows up with another act that is good, but just not up to the standard of the first. The first-act climax shouldn't be the movie's defining moment. Otherwise, it's a tremendous film.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket finds the perfect balance of humor and disturbing realism. With powerhouse performances from Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, and R. Lee Ermey, this movie packs a big punch, mostly due to the amazing direction of Stanley Kubrick.",fullmetaljacket
"My favorite film, one of the best films I've ever seen, thank you Kubrick for showing us this brilliant...no...amazing movie! Hope you rest in peace, with your other successes.",fullmetaljacket
"The first half of the movie is OK, and then the second half is like watching an entirely different movie, we have put some emotional effort into the characters for most of them not to show up again! It's actually kind of disappointing.",fullmetaljacket
Not for everyone but covers the subject in an very interesting and stylish way from start to finish. It proves the point that soldiers are normal people.,fullmetaljacket
"One of my favorites. A two part movie about training in boot camp and then action in Viet Nam. Humor, drama, suspense. A must see classic!",fullmetaljacket
I really dont want to say anything but its a must watch if you love cinema and if you want to see R. Lee Ermey brillant performance in this film. Much Love.,fullmetaljacket
"This is my 2nd favorite War film of all time (1st being ""Saving Private Ryan""). This film is great. The acting, and the war sequences were amazing in this film. This is definitely my favorite Stanley Kubrick film and one of my favorite films of all time.",fullmetaljacket
"Amazing movie and very fun to watch. First half was humorous, second half has suspense. I think a good idea would be a sequel set decades later about Pvt. Joker or Animal Mother replacing Gny. Sgt. Hartman's job as the Senior Drill Instructor",fullmetaljacket
"The 2nd best war film I've ever seen (first being Fury), and has terrific acting from everyone and great war elements to it. Definitely Stanley Kubrick's best movie.",fullmetaljacket
"Great pacing, characters, action, cinematography. Balances out some the depressing themes in the Vietnam War with some dark humor. The fun '60s music spices things up perfectly. Robert Lee Ermey is a legend and is the most iconic and quotable drill sergeant ever. Might be my favorite Stanley Kubrick film so far.",fullmetaljacket
"My 2nd favorite War film of all time (1st being ""Saving Private Ryan""). This film is great. The acting, and the war sequences were amazing in this film. This is definitely my favorite Stanley Kubrick film and one of my favorite films of all time.",fullmetaljacket
"One of the most raw war films to be made. No nicely wrapped ending or fluffy bits. Full Metal Jacket is what Platoon could have been without the self-importance. But then, Oliver Stone is no Stanley Kubrick.",fullmetaljacket
"Quality filmmaking, but also very cold, sterile, without much of a human touch. Kubrick's take on Vietnam is filled with amazing cinematography, great performances, and an anti-war message. The movie almost feels like two separate films with one showing the boot camp experience and the psychological toll is can take on recruits. The second is about the experience of soldiers in Vietnam. You never feel too invested in the characters, as little is fleshed out about who they are and why we should care. It ends on a somewhat anti-climactic and melancholy note, showing the pointlessness of war and the cost it takes in human lives. My main gripe is that it never truly ""feels"" like we are in Vietnam, due to the fact that it was shot in England with only a few imported palm trees to maintain the illusion. Too much gray and not enough green jungle to really make it look like Vietnam rather than a set in near London. Still a well made film and worth your time.",fullmetaljacket
This movie was really good!!! My favorite part of the movie is the training scenes and the jelly doughnut!!! Also my favorite part is the sergeant!!! He cracks me up every time!!! I thought Matthew Modine as Private Joker was great and he knew what he was doing!!! He alo made a great narrator throughout the movie!!!,fullmetaljacket
"A stark and uncompromising look at the Vietnam war, with a hyper-sense of realism and extremely impactful imagery. It's pacing gets a tad sluggish and the second act pales in comparison to the first but the movie is a masterpiece regardless.",fullmetaljacket
"Great performances, shocking and fun story, incredible cinematography and hard but realistic storytelling. This, Kubrick's one of the best works, is also one of the best war movies ever made.",fullmetaljacket
"""Born to kill"", this movie is not just about the war like the typical war movie and its cliches we've all seen but the psychology behind it. The first half of the movie it's a pleasure to watch with that darkly comic, the screenwriting is sensational, this film caught you since the opening scene with the original soundtrack.",fullmetaljacket
"Intense, iconic, and darkly hilarious at times. Stanley Kubrick's brilliant Vietnam war drama follows PVT. Joker, a USMC war correspondent for 'Stars&Stripes', through boot camp and eventually, through his war. There are the Kubrick themes. The duality of man. ""The Jungen thing, Sir!"" As Joker put it. I could talk about it for a long time. Almost as long as Apocalypse Now. And this film is a classic, right up there with that picture it's a must see. Music is used to good effect here and the whole film is very memorable. A mark of a great film is how memorable it is. The next day after watching this, I remembered everything. Especially the first act. R.Lee. Ermy. The Drill Sgt. Wow. What a performance. He steals the entire first act. Such a powerful and funny performance. All in all, it's a must see. Gunnery Sgt. Hartman: ""Well it looks to me like the best part of you ran down the crack of your momma's ass and ended up as a brown stain on the mattress! I think you've been cheated!""",fullmetaljacket
"Never underestimate Stanley Kubrick's ability to reach out of the screen and play with your brain like some cosmic Rubik's cube. It's a comedy, it's a tragedy. It's two short stories in one. It's a hilarious look at the shortcomings of men. It's a poignant and timeless allegory of the horrors of war. It's an investigation into enemies at home and enemies abroad. I guess he was trying to suggest something about the duality of man, sir.",fullmetaljacket
"A true cinematic masterpiece. Each and every scene has so much thought and emotion into it. Just randomly pause the movie at any point in time and not only is it visually stunning, but that still image also provides such a story. Dark humor, realism, social truths that are still relevant today, and scenes that will stick with you until you are old and grey. The best Vietnam, or might I say war movie, of all time.",fullmetaljacket
Great movie. Second half seems a little slow in the beginning but quickly picks it up in the end in the sniper sequences. Both endings of the halves are drawing parallels of each other. Very impactful movie on the dehumanization of individuals during the war.,fullmetaljacket
"I know people rave about their loooove of Kubrick but I can never understand why. He's obvious, clumsy and heavy handed in the way he delivers his messages and conveys emotion in films. His films in their entirety are the equivalent of the Bill Shatner acting method. If he thought something was important it needed LOUD MUSIC, and if a person was going crazy they needed to look straight at the camera from under their brow in a menacing fashion. This movie is one that embodies all of these characteristics and then some. If you want to be a person who feels smart by quoting a bad movie then by all means use this one. But if you'd rather go with a movie that was done better, had a clearer message, and is much less embarrassing to quote, go with Platoon or Apocalypse Now. But stop pretending like Kubrick was good at this. He wasn't.",fullmetaljacket
"Yet another great film from Kubrick. This movie skillfully examines the psychological effects of war on soldiers, and is one of the best war movies of all time.",fullmetaljacket
"Strong opening with the training process. However, not a very compelling story and is weaker towards the end. Not many standout performances other than R. Lee Ermey's character as the drill sergeant.",fullmetaljacket
"It's hard to evaluate this film on it's own merits when considering the fact that one of the greatest directors of all time, Stanley Kubrick, made it and I recently saw The Deer Hunter (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979). I will try to do that however as I still feel that divorced from the specter of those two elements this film doesn't completely work. I wasn't as disturbed as I should have been and I felt that a lot of the acting aimed for the sort of over the top pastiche that became iconic in a lot of Kubrick's other films but didn't quite reach it. It's not on the level of Barry Lyndon (1975) or A Clockwork Orange (1971) but it's unfair to ask for that level of quality with most films. This isn't a much watch unlike Kubrick's other work and I would recommend that you watch most of his other films before venturing to see this one. Private Joker, Matthew Modine, and Gomer Pyle, Vincent D'Onofrio, go through boot camp under the tutelage of Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann, R. Lee Ermey. Hartmann proves to be extremely tough and he turns all of the recruits against Pyle due to his being overweight which causes him to be physically and emotionally abused and ultimately commit a violent act. We jump forward to 1968 in the second half of the film as we see Joker become a journalist for The Stars and Stripes who write military propaganda. His relatively carefree life is interrupted when an attack on his marine base and he and other writers are left to defend themselves amongst the rubble. Eventually they discover that the sniper who murdered one of their friends is just a little girl but Joker is still pushed to kill her at her own request. The scenes in the film that work best are, in my opinion, those that come in the second half of the film. The first half felt like it was stealing from Catch-22 (1970) and MASH (1970) with the satirical elements it incorporated and while Ermey's performance is deserving of it's iconic status I felt he was a touch overused. The second half settled down a little and chose to satirize propaganda and then show the dark effects of the war on innocent people. I was emotionally impacted by the scenes that feature people being devastated by warfare and while other films show death and destruction better Kubrick at least shows he can make a film in which he is emotionally engaged. This may be a controversial opinion because I understand that a lot of people are big fans of the first half while they think the second drops into mediocrity, I would still tend to disagree. I suppose another thing I felt was missing from this film was an interesting visual style. Every other Kubrick film looks amazing and you feel as though the director has focused each shot intensely in an attempt to execute his outlandish vision. Cinematographer Douglas Milsome also worked on three of Kubrick's other films so he clearly knows how to make a film look beautiful but this film just looks sort of blah. Even Platoon (1986) looks better than this film and I have many problems with that film relating to how the director deals with the material he is working with. Not every film needs to look incredible to be affecting but a large part of the reason why Kubrick films are so brilliant are their visuals and you expect to see something new and exciting on the screen every time you watch one of his films. In the end I would say that this film is worth watching even if it's not a masterpiece because it's still post Paths of Glory (1957) Kubrick and we should treasure his work as he only provided us with a few great films but truly great ones at that. I am going to watch the only Kubrick film I have not seen this afternoon and I hope that it is better than this film but if it were on the same level I would still be able to appreciate it in some ways because it would still be better than most films.",fullmetaljacket
"Would've gotten a 5 star rating if the 2nd half of the movie(In Vietnam) was as good as the first. Ermy nailed the role as a drill sargent. The movie is unique as a war film because none of the other ones show how boot camp really was in those days. It's a great look at how the military molds young kids into killer soldiers. The second half it kinda felt like Kubrick didn't know what to have the characters do. Still it was entertaining, and actually really funny.",fullmetaljacket
"Classic Kubrick film. Disturbing and genius. People who say they don't like or don't get the second half do not understand this film or truly appreciate it. The second half does not make sense in some ways because WAR does not make sense. That is the entire message of this film. R. Lee Ermey definitely gives the most memorable performance in this film as drill instructor Sgr. Hartman. While it is difficult to choose a favorite Kubrick film, this is definitely in my top three!",fullmetaljacket
"Stanley Kubrick knows how to make good movies, that really aren't special. The first half of this movie was amazing. The drill sergeant, fantastic. The script and set-up, couldn't have been better made than this. This part was realistic and gripping at the same time. The second half though, was boring and forgettable. Severely lacking in action, character, and poignancy. It should have stopped when it was ahead. I recommend watching the first half and skipping everything else.",fullmetaljacket
"Kubrick depicts the raw reality of being a marine during both training and real action. Soundtrack, dialogue, occasional irony and action manage to keep you hooked up until the very end.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket set the standard for most contemporary war films. It doesn't have that much of a plot per se, but it is full of extremely memorable and startling moments. The horror is softened (or enhanced) by a great soundtrack.",fullmetaljacket
"One of my favorite all time war films, one reason why its one of my favorite wars films is because of its even handedness, even though the film is from an American soldiers perspective the ugliness of both sides of war is clear to see. Another reason I really like this film is its unapologetic dark humor and memorable characters.",fullmetaljacket
"Not a fully realistic war film, but director Stanley Kubrick is highly effective at getting his points across.. Hyper realism.. Hilarious first act, hyperreal second act.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket was Kubrick's take on war and what it entails. Divided into two stories this is one hard hitting film. The first focuses on a bunch of new recruits in boot camp and the other takes place smack in the middle of a warzone. Full of images that stick in mind and some great use of music Full Metal Jacket is Kubrick through and through. From the long takes to the nihilistic overtones there is a stamp of authority of the master filmmaker. The acting, as is the case with every Kubrick film is sublime especially Mathew Modine and Vincent D' Onofrio. If you want to see an auteur at work Full Metal Jacket is a film you should check out. (A master's outlook on war presented on film).",fullmetaljacket
This is essentially two movies. The first half set in a military boot camp is very entertaining and honestly really funny with the drill sergeant Hartman absolutely carrying the whole sequence with his stellar performance. The second half is set in Vietnam and is a lot darker with some unconventional filming that makes this half feel very surreal. The first half is a solid 10/10 and the second is a 8/10.,fullmetaljacket

"Stanley Kubrick has made many movies that people either love or hate, A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut, movies that are not very popular but are liked by some people, Barry Lyndon, Dr. Strangelove, Paths of Glory, and there are his movies that everyone pretty much loves, The Shining, and the movie I will be reviewing today, Full Metal Jacket. I picked this up at my local library on blu ray and watched it on a friday night. On the way home, my dad asked me what movie I got, I showed him the blu ray, and he was like ""that's a very good movie"" and yeah that was all. Watching Full Metal Jacket, it didn't remind me of other good war films I've seen. It was very different from Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk, Hacksaw Ridge, it is really unique, probably the most unique war film I've ever seen. The storytelling and the elements in the story about the Vietnam war really made it raw. That's how I'd describe the movie, raw. R. Lee Ermey really gave one of the best performances in history in this movie, in my opinion. Even though he was on screen for about 15 minutes, he made those 15 minutes so intense, so great, and gives the movie dark comedic scenes. I think his performance as Sgt. Hartman is one of the best performances of all time. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as a private that struggles in the beginning of the movie because of military training camp being too hard for him, and R. Lee Ermey's character being a hard mentor, challenging Vincent D'Onofrio's character physically and mentally, it is really compelling stuff. The part where he shoots Sgt. Hartman, then shoots himself, is one of the most jaw dropping scenes of all time. The look on Vincent D'Onofrio's face in that scene haunted me for the rest of that night. There is also another main character in this movie named Joker, (that's his nickname). He is in this military camp with Vincent D'Onofrio's character, and he goes through this camp, watching horrific things happen, you really get into the shoes of this character. The next acts of this movie is Joker going to Vietnam and experiencing the war. This part of the movie was really different from the first part back on Parris Island. A lot of people thought this 2nd part of the movie was not as good as the first part, but I thought both parts were great. The Vietnam war was portrayed so rough and raw in this movie, it was pretty breathtaking. The message/allegory of this story was so beautiful and 100% true, it really makes me look at war differently. The only issue I have with this movie is that I thought the movie really dragged at the middle of the film. Not much things were going on, there wasn't really much of a direction either, it just kind of felt like the story was going nowhere. Other than that, I thought this movie was really good. 9/10",fullmetaljacket
"Gran bel film firmato Stanley Kubrick. La pellicola è una di quelle in cui la storia è si importante ma la cosa più rilevante è il messaggio, la critica, che il regista vuole lanciare. In questo caso Kubrick si scaglia contro la guerra e l'addestramento militare che trasformano l'uomo in una macchina di morte, fatta solo per uccidere e infatti lo possiamo cogliere nel finale quando Joker uccide la ragazzina e i suoi compagni gli dicono di essere un ""duro"", o anche nel momenti in cui i personaggi difendono la base e nel mentre scherzano tra di loro. Il personaggio più umano è quello di Matthew Modine, ovvero Joker, e nonostante questo anche lui è diventato una macchina, non è più un uomo. Bellissimo il fatto che sull'elmetto, quindi sul cervello, avesse la scritta ""Born to kill"" e sul cuore avesse una spilla che rappresentava la pace. È stato bravissimo, ma Vincent D'Onofrio (Palla di lardo) e R. Lee Ermey (Sergente Hartman) sono stati strabilianti. Bella la colonna sonora, grandiosa la regia e anche la fotografia.

"What everyone has told me is true - the first half of this movie is really all that matters. The second half was..ok...but the first half is really what steals the show. R. Lee Ermey's depiction of a Drill Sergeant is nothing short of fantastic. Vulgar, disgusting, and somehow funny at the same time. I could listen to him yell insults all day. This is one of the better Kubrick films. I still think that 2001; A Space Odyssey is my favorite by far. IN HERE, YOU ARE ALL EQUALLY WORTHLESS TO ME!",fullmetaljacket
"Stanley Kubrick was already a legend when he made Full Metal Jacket- a war movie. The film is divided into two parts. The first focuses on a bunch of new recruits in boot camp and the other takes place smack in the middle of a warzone. Full of images that stick in mind and some great use of music Full Metal Jacket is Kubrick through and through. From the long takes to the nihilistic overtones there is a stamp of authority of the master filmmaker. The acting, as is the case with every Kubrick film is sublime especially Mathew Modine and Vincent D' Onofrio. If you want to see an auteur at work Full Metal Jacket is a film you should check out.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket (1987) ??? / ???? Stanley Kubrick's vivid depiction of Vietnam splits in two halfs; emotionally shattering examination of boot camp and actual fighting on the field. The first half is so compelling that the second suffers in comparison, as it covers more familiar ground. Still, it's a rich viewing, and performances of R. Lee Ermey as tough drill sergeant, Vincent D'Onofrio as private loosing his mind, a knockout. Not quite among Kubrick's titans (Paths of Glory, 2001, etc) but a powerful, unforgettable film.",fullmetaljacket
"Increíble ,realista y sincera, un film que desarrolla sus personajes de la manera comica y humana ,una obra bélica sin precedentes ,su balance cómico es muy acertado .",fullmetaljacket
"This film is one of the first that comes to mind when thinking of all of Kubrick's masterpieces, and it's not hard to see why. For starters, the setting brilliantly captures the tense atmosphere of Marine Corps training to prepare for war. This is best demonstrated when looking at the character Leonard Lawrence, better known as Private Pyle. Over the course of the first half of the film, Sargent Hartman, the brutal drill instructor, belittles him for being slow-witted and overall just not prepared for battle. To make matters worse he decides to punish the rest of the Marines for Pyle's mistakes. This is first seen when Pyle smuggles a doughnut because he could not deal with the feeling of hunger. Hartman retaliates by forcing the entire cabin to do intense exercises, causing them all to dislike Pyle. Tired of all of Pyle's screw ups, the entire bunk gives Pyle a beating. By each getting a towel, filling it with a bar of soap, and proceeding to hit him in the stomach repeatedly while others hold him down. After feeling immense pain and realizing that everyone hates him, Pyle loses all emotion and becomes a killing machine. Hartman and the others are very proud of him and all seems well until the next night. Private Joker, one of Pyle's fellow Marines, hears a noise in the restroom and decides to investigate only to find Pyle loading a rifle. Joker tells Pyle to go back to sleep and put his rifle away or else they will be in a world of shit. Pyle responds with, ""I'm already in a world of shit!"", and proceeds to repeat various chants that were spoken on their marches. After hearing all of the shouting Hartman storms in and proceeds to yell at Pyle and belittle him more. Void of all emotion and thought, Pyle shoots Hartman in the chest, killing him. Realizing what he had done, Pyle spends a few minutes reflecting, only before putting the rifle in his mouth and blowing his brains out. While all of this is very malicious and depressing, it is very realistic and corresponds to the tense environment of war to the point that it is almost beautiful. The training portion of the film is one of my favorite parts of any movie to this date earning this movie an easy five star rating. The section that illustrates war in Vietnam is also well made, but is honestly quite forgettable when looking at the first half of the film. Yet, this is still a movie that I would recommend to anyone, whether they typically enjoy films of this genre.",fullmetaljacket
"This is, quite simply, the greatest (anti)war film ever made. A film in two halves, the training segment is a perfect balance of dark humor & dramatic insanity, & the Vietnam segment is depressingly violent & visually impeccable. Though they are disparate, they work together to show the dehumanizing nature of all aspects of war: the ugliness, the complication, the lack of cinematic heroism. One of Kubrick's quickest paced, least opaque & most accessible films...& yet another directing masterpiece.",fullmetaljacket
"Unique, well crafted, and a story that doesn't have to overly develop it's characters to get the point across. Similar to Dunkirk in that manner, but executed a little bit better in my opinion.Great movie.",fullmetaljacket
"A film of two halves, with the first being far superior to the second. As the cadets are put through their paces at a strict training camp, we witness the gruelling nature of what it could possibly have felt like being at the mercy of a sadistic sergeant major. You'd like to hope that the scenes are exaggerated for our entertainment value, but I suspect there is an underlying truth about how the events had the potential to pan out in those days. In the 2nd half, we witness the boys in real life combat in the Vietnam war. On paper, this should have been better, more action, more blood, and more drama, however it didn't materialise. Whether I just felt bewildered by what seemed a completely new cast or whether I was completely sidetracked from giving it my full attention, it just felt very anticlimactic in comparison.",fullmetaljacket
"To me this was always two separate movies.The first part(boot camp) is very good mpstly because of of Eremy.The second part is a generic war picture.Take the first part, extent it, drop the second part and you have a perfect movie.",fullmetaljacket
"Unforgettable performance by R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor and very memorable performance by Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt Pyle. This movie gets very intense in basic training and there are basically 2 parts to the story. Basic Training and being in Vietnam. The first half of the movie is way better then the 2nd half. R. Lee shines as DI Hartman and gives the viewer a sense of how hard Basic Training is. the 2nd half of the film is set in Vietnam and is average at best. There is no real plot to the movie. It's main purpose is to show the viewer that war is hell and unpredictable. Not my favorite Kubrick film, but still a very good film.",fullmetaljacket
Though it occasionally stalls after the 45 minute mark. Stanley Kubrick’s Full Metal Jacket is a darkly comical and haunting depiction of the Vietnam War.,fullmetaljacket
Full Metal Jacket is a aggressive and hard edged war film from Stanley Kubrick! Great performances and brilliant direction and crazy action scenes make you feel for the characters!,fullmetaljacket
"Frankly, I loved the film. It was a little disorienting, in that there are essentially two different parts of the film. I got so invested in Pyle's story and watching that evolve, that I found myself having to readjust when the film segued into following Joker's story. Up until Pyle shot himself, I had assumed that this story was about Pyle. It was interesting to me that the perspective seemed to change in each part of the film. The first part seemed to be more from Pyle's perspective, to then set up the second part of the film being from Joker's perspective. It made me feel intrigued by the psyche of the men in the military. It made me also feel concerned for how the constant negating and invalidating affects these men. The pace of the film was also interesting. Things sort of seemed to have a slow build in the beginning up until Pyle's emotional turn took place. For me, the same thing happened in the second part of the film when Joker and his crew were backed into a corner with the Vietnamese. In both parts of the film, it was interesting that there was this slower-paced nonchalant approach to setting up these stories, however, once things got going we very much-so ""zoomed in"" to the conflict in the story and what was going on. Music was a big part of the movie, however, in these moments Kubrick chose to have no, or very little, music be a part of them. For me, it allowed me to be more attentive to what was going on and what was at stake.",fullmetaljacket
"An incredible achievement of dialogue, visual character development, tension, and the ability to throw us into the harsh mindset that soldiers are forced into during war. Definitely one of Kubrick's best.",fullmetaljacket
"sir, no sir.. Full Metal Jacket Just like The Clockwork Orange, it takes too much time to prove a point and even though it is finely detailed and explicitly executed the journey for around 2 hours just doesn't seem worthy at the end. Stanley Kubrick's smart adaptation and perfect execution works on its level and won't disappoint the fans but fails to deliver anything beyond that as the mere far fetched idea fades off slowly before one's eyes where even lousy editing too, becomes responsible. Matthew Modine at the centre of it pulls it off swiftly and smoothly but is overpowered by a stunning performance by Vincent D'Onofrio despite of just being a supportive character. Full Metal Jacket resonates too much with The Clockwork Orange as it raises similar questions, offers enough doubts and thrills which becomes redundant at a certain point and as always lacks better editing.",fullmetaljacket
One of the best Vietnam movies ever made. So many characters are still remembered to this day. Gunny made a career out of this movie.,fullmetaljacket
"Greatest movie of all time. It was flawless. As someone who's experienced military style training ,The boot camp scenes were spot on and very accurate to what it's like and a perfect representation of what military combat is.",fullmetaljacket
"It might not be pleasing, and it definitely isn't pretty, but it sure is well made. Kubrick's depiction of war is a shilling movie, from the beggining to the end, and leaves the viewer asking the question: was all this suffering worth it?",fullmetaljacket
The first act of the privates' training was authentic to Kubrick's style and I wish it lasted longer. Pyle's slow defeat from scrutiny could've made for a whole movie. Joker's casual job as a journalist was also an entertaining aspect but I began to lose interest as new characters were added half way through the film purely made for their interest in harsh kills.,fullmetaljacket
"Puntaje Original: 8.0 Divertida, intensa, reflexiva y oscura. Con una inremunerable actuación de R. Lee Ermey, que trae uno de los personajes más memorables del cine. Full Metal Jacket es una digna última película como director del más grande astro del cine Stanley Kubrick.",fullmetaljacket
The paradox of man; wanting peace through war. An experience of the endless death that war perpetuates and how it takes both strangers and loved ones while amounting to the same result--the continued cycle of violence.,fullmetaljacket
"As far as war films go, this is one of my favourites. I liked how it can be Funny at time's then changes to a really dark tone. I also really love the marine montage at the beginning.",fullmetaljacket
"The much-acclimated movie left me disjointed. The first half of the movie's storyline follows a platoon of U.S. Marines through their training, it's a laughter ride with its silly, stupid and vulgar jokes and I loved it. The second half focuses on the experience of one of the marines in the Vietnam War itself. This was boring, confusing and frustrating and I hated it. I had two very different experiences for two sides of the same storytelling.",fullmetaljacket
"Maybe not as good as it's been talked up to be, but still a solid war film. Based on Gustav Hasford's novel The Short Timers, the film's first half details the volunteers' harrowing boot-camp training under the profane, power-saw guidance of drill instructor Sgt. Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, a real-life drill instructor whose performance is one of the most terrifyingly realistic on record). Part two takes place in Nam, as seen through the eyes of the now thoroughly indoctrinated marines. Ironically, Full Metal Jacket was filmed almost entirely in England. ""Full Metal Jacket"" was one of the movies that was talked about when I praised films such as ""Hacksaw Ridge"". Apparently, this was the war film to behold, as it was just as good, if not better. I recently got the opportunity to view this movie and by that, it means I was in the mood for it and I saw it on Netflix. I really don't think this film is as good as its reputation suggests it is, but it's still solid. It's certainly the best film ever made, but it's certainly not bad. I guess it's just dated if anything. I'm not sure if this is a complaint or not, but this really did feel like two different films. The first hour of this film took place at boot camp. It felt repetitive, it dragged a bit, and even though it ended shockingly, it still wasn't enough for an A+ film. Then, when the second half came on, it became an entirely different film. In fact, all the weight the first half had became meaningless. So essentially, this was two different movies. I guess that really is a problem in the end, because by that point, why care about anything that happened in either half? The acting wasn't that great. The only real solid performance from here was Matthew Modine's performance. I actually thought he did a really good job. I thought his performance stood out amongst the rest, especially when other ones stood out negatively. A lot of the performances in this movie were less than adequate. They were either cheesy, cringe worthy, laughable, or just downright awkward. I don't think the best cast was chosen for this film, regardless of what the persona of their character was supposed to be. Although it's not the most visually grossing or hard hitting war film, it boasts these concepts and ideas that are pretty tough at times. The overall language and what was acceptable to say back then is completely different than it is today. I liked seeing that difference in past cultures and how we acted compared to how we do today. It also showed some things that did show that war is ugly. It's not pretty, it has its moments, and I think this film showed those aspects well. In the end, this isn't the best movie by any means. It's good, it has its fair share of problems. Maybe it's a bit dated, but maybe it was really good for its release year. In the end, I'm fairly neutral with it.",fullmetaljacket
"Full metal Jacket is an excellent war film directed by the legendary director Stanley Kubrick. Great performances are given from the whole cast and the true hell of war is shown. Although it isn't Stanley Kubrick's best film in my opinion, it still can show the audience how good he really is.",fullmetaljacket
"Puntaje Original: 8.0 Divertida, intensa, reflexiva y oscura. Con una inremunerable actuación de R. Lee Ermey, que trae uno de los personajes más memorables del cine. Full Metal Jacket es una digna última película como director del más grande astro del cine Stanley Kubrick.",fullmetaljacket
"A movie divided in two almost different parts, one focusing on a rather effectively funny and iconic set up, mocking the military training perspective, and the other, demonstrating a powerfully directed satire of the already harsh and visceral war, particularly centered in Vietnam, showing both, a strongly black humored flick, and an extremely effective war movie with all the great elements out of Kubrick's techniques, not to mention the show-stealer R. Lee Ermey in one of history's most iconic performances.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket is not just about war, but rather the psychology behind it. A smart move from the legend that was Stanley Kubrick. We've all seen many war films, a genre that is well explored from a variety of different conflicts. Full Metal Jacket however chooses to go behind the scenes and focus on the training process that changes well intentioned men into trained lethal killers. You could easily split this in half and have two separate films, the first half being more psychologically charged whereas the latter showcasing the brutality of warfare. A ridiculously serious drill sergeant practically bullying a trainee marine so harshly that it slowly turns him into an unstable psychopath. That right there, was some really good psychology and made the film so much more interesting. Sure the Vietnam War scenes were depicted with a substantial amount of fire, blood and guns but it was the first half that really captivated me. Vincent D'Onofrio was the stand out for me, both convincing and expressive through his face. Matthew Modine was good, probably his best performance. Lee Ermey deserves recognition just for somehow managing to not lose his voice from all the shouting. Characterisation was present, perhaps not fully fleshed out as I would like but was just enough for me to care about them. Yet again though, it's the technical marvel that wins...Stanley Kubrick. His directing style is so damn flawless. The nice clean long takes, actors looking directly into the camera, slow motion deaths (particularly in the sniper shootout)...he is just phenomenal. Script was sharp as well. A great section of dialogue where our lead character wears a peace badge and a helmet that says ""born to kill"" for which he describes represents the duality of man. That really stuck with me. So whilst it might feel like two separate films (due to that ridiculously quick transition), it's hard not to appreciate everything that's shown to us. Another hit from Mr. Kubrick.",fullmetaljacket
"It takes the idea of military training and the vietnam war, to turn into a great pretty funny, realistic drama showing how tough training can be on people, and how awful the Vietnam War was.",fullmetaljacket
"This movie was incredible. The 1st act was the best part of the movie, it dies down a big during the second half, but picks up again with action packed moments. This movie was fantastic.",fullmetaljacket
"I love this ending so much. The movie that introduced me to the greatest auteur to ever auteur. tanleyKubrick was one of kind. ullMetalJacket is one the greatest movies ever made, definitely in the top 5 in the War category. The first 45 minutes are riveting, then it lulls a bit but it's never dull. The last 40 minutes are can't even pause to pee good.",fullmetaljacket
"The film from 1987 marks something of another comeback for director Stanley Kubrick. It was released to positive reviews but I can see some chinks in the film. It focuses on raw recruits to the US Marines at the time of the Vietnam War. The psychological horrors it brought to some of these recruits is focused on. The film is split into two main acts. The first half of the film focuses on the training of a platoon of marines on Parris Island, in the U.S. One of the recruits Private Lenny Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) struggles with army life and the loud rule of the Sergeant (Lee Ermey). For about an hour of the film we see the portly Lawrence be for want of a better word be bullied by his commanding officer and fellow recruits before he snaps. The warning signs are all there. The raised eye facial expressions that are a trademark of Kubrick films (A Clockwork Orange and The Shining spring to mind.) The recruits become competent users of killer weapons and are warned by the Sergeant himself in one scene how ruthless killers like Lee Harvey Oswald were trained to shoot by the US Marines. The second half of the film is set in Vietnam itself in a variety of locations. Here the film became confusing as it drifted from one set piece to another. However the overriding theme that 'normal' civilians become killers for want of a better word or witness killing is the main theme. A film that shows the real horrors of conventional wzrfare to recruits to the army 'conscripted'.",fullmetaljacket
"One of Kubrick's more concrete films, FMJ is perhaps my favorite of his due to each facet and character being so well developed and multi-dimensional. The film still resonates today because of this.",fullmetaljacket
"While the movie never quite lives up to its incredible first act, it more than simply passes with dazzling cinematography and daring wit, making it a great war film overall.",fullmetaljacket
"A strangely hypnotic film. The uniformity of boot camp and the lack of effect most of it has on actual warfare is on full, blunt display in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" and it makes for an extremely intense experience. There's also quite a lot of humor throughout, but the further the film progresses, the dirtier the jokes feel. I know a lot of people consider this to be an anti-war movie, and I don't disagree. But instead of preaching the beliefs of the filmmakers throughout, events are simply shown and the audience is responsible for deciding how they feel about it all. I don't even know how I'd go about recommending this movie, because while I really like it, there's such a wide range of tones and atmospheres that I wouldn't know how to describe it as just one package. And it really should be quite jarring with all the tonal shifts, but all of it manages to flow together and feel coherent. A satirical war drama is how I imagine it could be most effectively described.",fullmetaljacket
"Kubrick excels in his use of appropriate music to improve a scene, better than Quentin Tarantino even. The confusion of war is well described in this thought-provoking film and the PT scenes were stellar in their attempts to describe the initiation that all military personnel go through. R. Lee Ermey steals the show and lifts it to a higher art form. A must-see for any war movie enthusiast.",fullmetaljacket
"Phenomenal, nearly perfect, first half. Vincent D'Onofrio and R. Lee Ermey make it impossible to look away. Quality dips slightly in the second half, but still outshines most other films of its type.",fullmetaljacket
"I believe it is my favorite war (or better yet, anti-war) movie of all time. There was and never will never be a film like this one.",fullmetaljacket
"Intense ,satirical and Ultra cool. Kubrick's take on The Vietnam war may not boast the most original of themes, but it is exceedingly effective at communicating them.9/10",fullmetaljacket
"Greedy, darkly funny, horrendous and scary, ""Full Metal Jacket"" might not had overcomed ""Paths of Glory"" with regard to the commentary on the nature of the war, but sure it was an important movie in the 80's in America. Kubrick remained relevant for a lot of years and he proved that he could make another equally disturbing war flick.",fullmetaljacket
"A great film, a good balance of story and action. The film does a good job showing the emotional and mental struggles soldiers face in both training for a war and fighting one. I also enjoy the music played in the film. I feel the music helps the era this film is based in and the music chosen for the scenes of which the music is played in fits really well. Overall I enjoy this film every time I watch it.",fullmetaljacket
"A typical Kubrick masterpiece, divided into two distinct plot areas. The first half of the film is set at U.S. Marine Corps Basic Training at Parris Island, South Carolina amidst the Vietnam War. The audience is introduced to a variety of draftees who are to be transformed from civilians into killers, at the hands of Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman ( R. Lee Ernst). The second half of the film follows Corporal ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine), one of the Marines from the first segment as he works as a military journalist for Stars and Stripes, following a Marine infantry squad during the Tet Offensive. The film is overwhelmingly ""anti-war"". A major theme in the first segment is the brainwashing of humans to become ruthless killers. The second half seems more disconnected but a strong sense of apathy towards winning the war and a lack of purpose in being there rounds off one of Stanley Kubrick's more overlooked films from his later career.",fullmetaljacket
"I don't know whether Kubrick has lost all his masterful skills or he just needed some more time on his ""hiatus"" to put up equally surpassing films about Vietnam war. The first half was far meatier than supposed to be sumptuous ending that' s rather insipid of his benchmarked standards.",fullmetaljacket
The movie works better as a superficial social commentary on the Vietnam War than an actual movie story because there is no plot apparent at all.,fullmetaljacket
"The first act of Full Metal Jacket is basically perfection. It is pure genius as we get a feel for life in boot camp, and the damaging effects these difficult training techniques can have on recruits. While the quality of the film-making continued once Joker left boot camp, the story dropped off a little. There were still flashes of greatness, but it didn't gel into a complete story as well as I expected. However, the themes were effectively conveyed. You really get a feel for how damaging war can be on the men who must fight it, and what the military is compelled to do in order to keep those men fighting (even in a lost cause.) The final confrontation of the film is devastating and I love how it wraps things up and pays off on things foreshadowed up to that point. In fact, the more I reflect on the movie, the more I recognize its brilliance. I wonder if, upon further viewings, I might find that this is truly a 5-star classic. The only thing that makes me skeptical about the quality of Full Metal Jacket is Matthew Modine. I don't think he's the best actor for this role, and he doesn't really ""become"" the character. Everyone else seems perfectly fit to the film (particularly Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Hartman) but he stands out as an actor delivering an uncomfortable performance that doesn't work as well as I would like. Despite that if you haven't seen Full Metal Jacket, and you have the stomach for war movies that feel gritty and realistic, then make watching it a priority.",fullmetaljacket
"The beginning is definitely the most gripping and enjoyable, and it seems to drag on in the second and third act. Joker isn't the most relatable character, and even borders on irritating. However, this movie does the job of showing the worst the Vietnam War had to offer and didn't hold back",fullmetaljacket
"The boot camp part of this movie is 5 stars, the 2nd half is just OK. Kubrik's decision to go with R.Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant was pure genius! Ermey's ad hoc dialog was over-the-top hilarious and totally made the first half of this movie.",fullmetaljacket
"Probably the first Kubrick movie I've seen that could have been directed by someone else. It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's lacks his signature style once you get past the boot camp segment. I think this is why a lot people say that the boot camp portion is better than the larger portion of the movie that actually takes place in Vietnam. Spoilers: It's not. There is a difference between being anti-military and anti-war, neither opinions are clearly right or wrong and that (among some other themes, masculinity being the other most obvious one) is what this movie is about. In boot camp we all want to be Joker. He's the intellectual, sarcastic one who understands ""the duality of man"" after all. But when you get on the ground Animal Mother starts to make a whole lot more sense. Overall I think it could have been a bit better if it had sunk into a more definitive style and the voice over could have been removed without losing almost anything of importance. But even if it is a weaker Kubrick film, it is still very much worth watching.",fullmetaljacket
"A classic for sure , 5th time seeing this one i think but nice to see again , funny drill-jogging songs and enough acting . Happy there was no 2 hour shootings ! SOMDVD",fullmetaljacket
"One of my least favorite Kubrick films, but not that bad as a movie. The film drags slightly towards the end, most of the great moments come from the first half of the film, and some of the scenes felt out of place and unimportant to the rest of the picture.",fullmetaljacket
"Back on my IMDB Top 250 project. This is # 140...110 to go. Loved this movie...cannot believe I never watched it before. I love Kubrick, though I am not always sure if I understand what he is getting at. Here the utter pointlessness of the way the movie is divided I think is supposed to convey how pointless the Vietnam War was. There really wasn't much of a story, just a series of events pulling the characters along. They fight, they die, with no speculation as to why...just like the war.",fullmetaljacket
I don't think anyone other than Kubrick could have made this film the way it is. I absolutely love the boot camp half of the film and man that bathroom scene was incredibly intense. Huge props to D'Onofrio for making me pretty terrified. The Vietnam half of the film was very good as well. Those tracking shots really made you feel like you were there moving with the troops.,fullmetaljacket
"Dozens of lines have become woven into pop culture, but don't think for a second this is an easy watch. Brutal, cold, and most certainly cynical, but one of the best war movies ever made.",fullmetaljacket
"The first half is a terrifying look into basic army training, the second half is an equally terrifying look into the Vietnam War. Incredibly well acted, most notably by the boot camp instructor and Private Pyle. I really enjoyed the first half, it was revealing and very shocking, the second half isn't quite as good, but that doesn't mean it was bad, I enjoyed the second half almost as much, though it does feel a little bit too long, Full Metal Jacket is a masterpiece about a group of soldiers in the Vietnam war.",fullmetaljacket
One of the top 5 war movies of all time. I still prefer the first half to the second but it's all good. Fantastic movie.,fullmetaljacket
"Full metal jacket, is it Apocalypse now, no!! Is it a Francis Ford Coppola film, no! Is it a Stanley Kubrick film trying to bring in what is man and how to be strong and fearless into a film yes. What's again by is Rich story rich cinematography and rich acting and comedy mix in with a wartime film to Vietnam. Absolutely!! I was with this film it doesn't get the best deserve that it should be. As my only favorite of Stanley Kubrick and I give every single of his film a perfect 10 because of what I really desire and films that Stanley Kubrick brings into cinema. Clockwork Orange is very simple and yet fun to watch. Full metal jacket is doing the same thing. And is trying to make fun of the horror of war that is the only topic that Stanley Kubrick is bringing into this film genre. Full metal jacket is a must watch for everybody to see you to witness what man has to fear and yet of what is fearless. One of the best executed films that I ever seen that brings in the Vietnam war which it is a fake that the government has to bring in it to the American people. From Boot Camp to war. This is a strong telling of what is soldier went through to Vietnam. And yet deserves the recognition that Stanley Kubrick absolutely deserves and his film. Grade A perfect 10",fullmetaljacket
"A cool, but dramatic war movie, a disturbing and powerful one too. I haven't seen many other war flicks, but it's been said, and I can says too that this is one of the best war movies ever. I liked the fact that there are two different parts and locations in this movie, the first training part and then the second combat part, which was the best. The constent war violence will surely disturb you even just a bit. But it's a great movie, really one to see, and even has a small bit of comedy to it, and sick ass R Lee Ermey is so comedicly good as the bastard ass general. Definitly recommended !!",fullmetaljacket
"Pretty good, not great. Drags in spots. First 40 min are like pitch-perfect. I'd call this a minor work. But Kubrick's minor works are way better than most people's major works, so it's definitely worth seeing obviously.",fullmetaljacket
"Born to Kill. From director Stanley Kubrick comes the nihilistic Vietnam War film Full Metal Jacket. The story follows a marine as he goes through basic training and does a tour in Nam as a war correspondent for Stars and Stripes. Unfortunately the storytelling is weak and disjointed, and uses randomly inserted voice-over, delivered ham-fistedly by Matthew Modine, to try to tie everything together. None of the performances are especially good, aside from R. Lee Ermey; whose performance as a drill sergeant has become iconic. However, Kubrick's directing is impressive, and features some incredibly evocative imagery. Yet without a compelling story, Full Metal Jackets ends up falling flat.",fullmetaljacket
"Does anyone actually watch this movie past the boot camp scenes? If it was just the boot camp it would be a 5, but with the serious downhill from there I can't rate it more than a 4.",fullmetaljacket
"People definitely shouldn't take Stanley Kubrick for granted, 'cause every time he says that he wants to make a movie different from his previous one, he always deliver. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is as different from ""The Shining"" as two movies could possibly be, and yet they are also similar in some ways. The concept of insanity lures in both movies and are shown in very successful ways both times. The first half of ""Full Metal Jacket"" blew me away and I enjoyed every single insult that came out of the mouth of Sergeant Hartman's mouth, who were beautifully portrayed by R. Lee Ermey. The second half, however, was a bit disappointing, because it took some time for me to get used to the new warfare surrounding, which wasn't really present at all in the first half of the movie. Matthew Modine is really good in the movie and he is without a doubt the best thing in the second half of the movie. This movie is intense, it's dark and it's very good and can definitely be locked into the vault of great Stanley Kubrick movies.",fullmetaljacket
"The training portion of the movie in the first half is some of the finest military material I have ever seen on the big screen. R. Lee Ermey is sensational while D'Onofrio's final few scenes are truly haunting. Once the movie moves to Vietnam I thought it lost a lot of momentum. But that first half, wow!",fullmetaljacket
"Kubrick's Frank and stark portrayal of Vietnam is sobering but also uplifting in a strange sort of way. The beginning showing the recruits training is just wonderful with Lee Ermy as the drill instructor completely stealing the show. When he goes you feel it!! But the reality of Vietnam comes alive in the second section and it really does!! In my opinion, the best Vietnam War movie ever made. I just love the ending....Mickey Mouse. Doesn't that say it all?",fullmetaljacket
"Was there ever a war (or anti-war) movie so tightly told? Each second gripping, the plot darkens quicker than the night, and no man (or woman or child) safe. Vincent D'onofrio's performance was perfect. It's not a movie you'd watch again and again, though....once every decade would suffice.",fullmetaljacket
Stanley Kubrick's dark and foreboding tale of US Marines during the Vietnam war. Movies like this make me glad that I never got involved in any war. The Vietnam war ended right after I graduated high school.,fullmetaljacket
"I love all Kubrick's films. Full Metal Jacket is my favourite. The genius of Kubrick made his war and army film stand far above all war or army films. The very young and talented Matthew Modine, Vincent D´Onofrio and Adam Baldwin played their career defining roles. Once an army recruit myself nearly four decades ago, the hellish marine training scenes truly struck a cord of bitter sweet reminiscence. Perhaps the most famous film to also stereotyped asian prostitutes catchy soliciting phrase ´Me so horny, me love you long time´. Kubrick didn´t spare us racists references like gooks and niggers that added realism. They came quick and fast as the marines got mired in the unwinnable Vietnam war. The horrors of a well hidden enemy sniper inflicting casualties on a passing section of marines was brilliantly conveyed. Even when the sniper wore two pony tails.",fullmetaljacket
"I really liked the movie, it really shows how a war actually is and especially what happens in times of training, like the thing that Gomer Pyle did, when/before he shot Sergeant Hartman, these kind of things might not always happen, but ofcourse, the chance is always present, also, i like the acting, it was quite funny from time to time (mostly that was Private Joker, and sometimes with Private Cowboy), I can really recomend this movie to others, but watch with caution, as it might not be a movie for everyone.",fullmetaljacket
"Well, wasn't this a fun ride. The first half at boot camp was my favorite. The dialogue is great, and it gets fun. The second half was a bit more tense.",fullmetaljacket
"I had to re-watch this film after many years. It's a brilliant Stanley Kubrick classic. If I'm not mistaken it was acclaimed as the best war movie ever made until ""Saving Private Ryan."" Back in the 80s I owned this film on VHS and it was great watch it widescreen as it was meant to be watched. Some classics scenes early on with a particular drill sergeant that has a darker comical edge to it.",fullmetaljacket
One of my all time favourite movies just a joy to watch from start to finish with some amazing characters and some great lines to quote. The film has some laugh out loud scene with some scenes even hard to look at. In my opinion this is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and will go down in movie history 5/5,fullmetaljacket
"What a sucker punch. Filmed with such precision, intensity, suspense, and grit, this is an unbelievable piece of cinema. Kubrick was a master of creating characters and stories that really get under your skin. Private Pyle's descent into madness was haunting. The shift from boot camp to Vietnam seemed awkward to me. The tone was slightly off, and it momentarily pulled me out of the story. It very quickly yanked me back in once Joker found himself in the front lines. The final scene genuinely had me holding my breath with a knot in my stomach. Kubrick is by far my favorite filmmaker of all time.",fullmetaljacket
"The genius of Stanley Kubrick applied to the Vietnam War. This film is starkly divided into halves. The first at military training camp and the latter in war action. The cinematography is as great as you would expect from Kubrick. This is his typical low on dialogue, high on visuals method that is his trademark. In my opinion, no one comes close to this master. Full Metal Jacket does not have American propaganda such as Saving Private Ryan. It is much more personal. It is more of a study of the soul of its protagonists similar to All Quiet On The Western Front (1930). This should be regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. It reminds me how great a film-maker Kubrick was. He made few films, but each was arguably a masterpiece. This is contrasted to Spielberg, whose Hollywood production machine and big budgets churn out poor, good and great movies of all kinds, but not the art of a master class,",fullmetaljacket
"With a simple message and a simple structure, perhaps Full Metal Jacket wants to convey the experience of war as viscerally as possible. But it's hard to call this a war film, as there's no one to root for, or sympathize with, or identify with. This is certainly a Kubrick film: masterfully crafted and interesting with naturalistic performances and provocative images. But it's also something less: in its negativity and cynicism and dehuminization, it's more of a nihilist jaunt through violence and depravity than an artistic statement. There's no real tragedy, only the fate of poor Gomer Pyle, probably the unique spirit that can't survive in the army. Instead of hinting at his themes, Kubrick has his ""Joker"" shout them at you, informing his conversant that the peace symbol and ""born to kill"" on his helmet represents ""the duality of man"". Perhaps Full Metal Jacket is about nothing more than how humans can kill and be killed. Or perhaps it's a meandering and ultimately toothless attempt to satirize war by having monstrous men do monstrous things on camera. But what we'll never know is why Kubrick slowed down so suddenly, how the man who once wished to film Napoleon with 50,000 real soldiers settled for R Lee Ermey slinging violent language at young men. How can the same man who made 2001 make Full Metal Jacket after Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter already existed? What happened to the compelling and heroic humanity of Paths of Glory, or unstoppable craftsman of The Shining? It's safe to say we'll never know. But as for Full Metal Jacket, there's blood, there's yelling and there's death. There's men who are mere cartoons of men, foreigners who amount to nothing more than whores and cowardly snipers. Lacking the dynamism and sheer brilliance and beauty of every Kubrick film from Paths of Glory to The Shining, Full Metal Jacket just doesn't measure up. You'll laugh at first, until you realize that a man is being tortured on screen, and then you'll hate the rest of them, and you might just wish that they all die, or better, that they all get killed, which is apparently all that humans can do according to this movie.",fullmetaljacket
"Usually you would think that a movie about the Vietnam War, the actual ""war"" parts of the movie would be the ones that are exciting and keep you the most interested. That was not the case for me watching Full Metal Jacket. I found that it was the complete opposite actually. This movie is somewhat split into two totally different parts. Kubrick depicts a group of Marines during their experience in boot camp, with a downright brutal drill sergeant. You follow these guys through all of their training and day to day routines getting ready to get their assignment and get shipped off to Vietnam to fight for the country. This is actually the part of the movie I enjoyed the most. When they actually get to the war I felt the movie starts to drag a little bit. Maybe it was just that the boot camp was so intense and the story of Private Pile so engrossing and somewhat disturbing towards the end that I just thought the movie could have honestly ended there. This movie surely isn't for everyone, I do not feel it is a classic war movie, but it is solid nonetheless.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket! Full Metal Jacket is directed by Stanley Kubrick and is an outstanding film that features excellent performances from all, terrific cinematography and a well matched score to really improve and work with the tone of this film. I thought this was my least favourite Kubrick film and i still really enjoyed it. My only problem with full metal jacket is that, i don't care about the characters that much, except for Vincent D'onfrio's and when he killed himself halfway through the movie, i was a little disapointed, he was by far my favourite character and he was killed off like that. i don't think it was a bad choice for the way the film was going, but i definatley would have liked it a tad more if he were in it until the credits. So, i really enjoyed Full Metal Jacket. What's your favourite Kubrick film?",fullmetaljacket
"Aside from having a terrific memory of catching this in the theaters on opening night (Snuck out of the house to meet my friends, got hammered like shit and then caught this at a midnight show), this is probably the best Vietnam movie that's not really a Vietnam movie. It had the misfortune of being released during the mid-80's/early-90's Vietnam movie wave so it got lumped in with middling-to-shitty movies like ""Hamburger Hill"" and ""Casualties of War."" Watching it separate from that period, it's Stanley Kubrick at the top of his game and a perfect bookend for his ""Paths of Glory."" The Parris Island sequence is so strong that absolutely nothing that comes after it, even the relative novelty of urban warfare in Hue City, can hope to top it, but the second half is more impressive on a purely technical level (tons of single-take sequences, somehow turning the Eastend of London into a pretty fair facsimile of Phu Bai and surrounding areas, a scarily mean performance from Adam Baldwin as a sort of proto-Jayne Cobb) while ramping up the black comedy to 11. We'll just ignore how ""Me so horny"" got perverted into every white and black asshole's opening comeon to Asian girls (these morons don't know that credit ratings aren't sexually transmitted), but it says something about Kubrick's greatness/genius/whatever as a director and writer that so many images, lines, and other snapshots from ""FMJ,"" ""2001,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and ""The Shining"" are forever ingrained into Western pop culture.",fullmetaljacket
"I certainly have mixed feelings about this movie. I LOVED the training portion of the story, but after that, the story just kind of disappeared for me. Lots of great writing, lots of great acting, but I just don't see this as being as ""great"" as people suggest. Still, as far as war movies go, it's pretty good.",fullmetaljacket
"A solid film from Kubrick. Not his best, but it's really quite good. The first half of the movie alone makes it worth a watch.",fullmetaljacket
"The conventional wisdom, that the boot camp section is great while the combat scenes are disappointing, fails to recognize how well the two halves of the movie mirror each other in both violent and sexual imagery.",fullmetaljacket
"Abandoning the standard story-telling structure of beginning, middle, and end, Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" instead favors a ""day-in-the-life-of"" approach to the Vietnam War, with no conflict or resolution. This allows it to hit a lot of the same beats as ""Apocalypse Now"" (particularly the deep psychological aspects), but in a way that feels completely different. Featuring R. Lee Ermey's iconic performance as Drill Sergeant Hartman and one of the most realistic depictions of the Vietnam War to date, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a worthwhile examination of the brutalities of war.",fullmetaljacket
"Those posed to think that the army is this amazing thing and it can't be mad fun of will not like this movie. Though it shows what could really go on in the army during one of the worst wars ever. This movie is satirical, intense, engaging, brilliant, and well shot. I'm on a Kubrick movie marathon and so far this is his second best movie. Right behind The Shinning and right above 2001 a space odyssey. It's a movie worth seeing but not the best Vietnam war movie ever. Apocalypse now beats it. 9.3",fullmetaljacket
"Apparently my general opinions on this movie are pretty common: I loved the first half and enjoyed the second half a little less. There's a number of reasons for why, but I think the main one is that the first half has this propulsive quality to it that the second half just lacks. Every scene in the first half just zips by because of the drill instructor Sgt. Hartman, who just never lets up, screaming constantly so it's impossible to look away even for a second (this is especially because R. Lee Ermey is so magnetic in the role). The pacing of the first half feels flawless; the audience still needs to feel small moments of reprieve out of necessity, and so those are provided for in the scenes between Pyle and Joker. You really feel for Pyle in those scenes, and get this sense that he's a gentle giant, this poor ignorant guy who just needs someone to be there for him when he's relentlessly tortured by Hartman. Joker provides that kind relief that Pyle (and the audience) needs in between exhausting scenes with Hartman. And then that all ends when Pyle is assaulted by his fellow Marine volunteers, and Joker reluctantly takes part. It's pretty tragic because Joker doesn't realize at the time that if he had stood up for Pyle, if he'd stuck by him in his hardest moments, maybe what inevitably happens wouldn't have happened. And yeah, we haven't even talked about that final scene, in which Pyle kills Hartman and then himself. Just crazy, man. I sort of saw it coming that he would go crazy, but I somehow thought the movie wouldn't go there, and it did. The second half has a lot of standout images and dialogue that make it far from pointless. Adam Baldwin's character, Animal Mother, is an interesting guy because it's pretty damn heartless until the end, when he vows to get revenge on the sniper who killed his friends, and then in the last scene, when he's disgusted by the thought of killing a little girl. There are some funny lines, like Joker's talk about the peace sign and the 'born to kill' writing representing the 'duality of man,' and there are some interesting, thematically strong interludes, like when one soldier reveals that the guy sitting next to him under a blanket is a dead Vietnamese soldier, brought back as some sort of sick prize. All of these moments of originality and thematic potency are especially powerful because of Stanley Kubrick's direction. He shoves you into all of these scenes and forces you to confront them; when Rafterman records the man with the pet Vietcong carcass on camera, we see it from the camera's point of view, so it's like the twisted soldier is telling us directly. There are a lot of moments like that in the movie, when people seem to be staring right at us, especially at the end, when the wounded sniper girl looks up at us and begs us to shoot her. And then there's the whole recurring idea of the 'thousand yard stare,' and Joker's final action in killing the young girl and achieving that stare. His choice to kill her, while merciful in a way, is dark because we've seen him resisting darkness the whole movie, and we've hoped that maybe he could make up for his role in Pyle's bullying. But finally he kills the girl, and it's ostensibly merciful, but it sure looks like execution to us. So there are a lot of images in the second half that are great and carry a lot of emotional and satirical heft, even if that meaning is as reductive as ""war sucks,"" something that tons of movies, like Apocalypse Now, have already done. And the shapelessness that makes me not like the second half as much has been said to have a point. War, after all, is shapeless and confusing and chaotic and messy. Still, just because a movie's unpleasant (exaggerating for effect here) structure and pacing are that way for the express purpose of making a point doesn't mean they're enjoyable on a shallow level, and I like my movies to be at least somewhat entertaining on a shallow level. There's a ruthless efficiency to the first half that's inevitably missed in the second level, even if the formal elements continue to support the tone of the respective sections. Overall, this was a movie I really enjoyed, with a kickass, tragic first half with a unique setting in a boot camp, and a second half that was a little less enjoyable because of its slow-paced shapelessness and the absence of Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. Still, there were enough vivid images and nice dialogue throughout the second half that it made up for most of its shortcomings and delivered an adequate second half to an ambitious, dark story.",fullmetaljacket
"Kubrick consegue extrair o máximo de seus atores - e o resultado, aliado ao belo design de produção e à mais uma grande direção dele, é excelente, num dos grandes filmes contra a guerra em si, usando como cenário a Guerra do Vietnam.",fullmetaljacket
"""Full Metal Jacket"" doesn't cover anything new for Vietnam War films, but is just as raw, vivid, and engrossing as past additions to the genre.",fullmetaljacket
"By 1987, numerous Vietnam films have arrived to the silver screen, the most notable example being Coppola´s ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Deer Hunter"", and Stone´s ""Platoon"". So what could Kubrick offer? The answer: The polarizing ""two films in one"" movie ""Full Metal Jacket"". We follow the training and service of some young men who are eager to ""fight the good fight"" in Vietnam. Out of all the short list of Stanley Kubrick films, this is the film that I consider the most peculiar and experimental as I find the choices Kubrick made bizarre but extremely fascinating. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is this intriguing version of the Vietnam War that has solid acting with the best being R. Lee Ermey in an iconic role and Vincent D´Onofrio; the dialog is extremely sharp edge and vulgar but surprisingly is hilarious at times and mostly memorable, Kubrick´s most distinctive use of music as they are widely popular songs or highly irrelevant to the war setting, an uneven pacing that at times takes you out of the experience but at others it flawlessly works as it literally throws you into the scene, the cinematography is as gorgeous as most Kubrick films, a distant and omnipresent storytelling that creates this cynical style, the themes are executed extremely effectively, some of the visuals are haunting and realistic, and Kubrick provides his most experimental directing as most of the time it is fast and feels like the whole film is a montage. The biggest criticisms the film are that the first half is incredible but the second is dull and forgettable, of course the most iconic and memorable section is the first half and while the second half never reaches that level of quality it also has some memorable moments, particularly the climax of the film. The other criticism is the overall feel of the film (some Vietnam vets consider it extremely accurate but others consider it a fantasy take of the war) because it is not like other Vietnam films where they are set in a jungle and have more moral dilemmas; it is an odd way to present war but I believe that the film is not about Vietnam but about war in generally due to its dehumanization themes (actually the visuals are more reminiscent of urban warfare and the War on Terror, which is scary considering this is a film from the 80´s). ""Full Metal Jacket"" is an experimental take of the Vietnam War that feels like two great movies smashed together via montage. While it is by no means one of the Kubrick´s greatest, it is not one of the weakest. It is funny, haunting, heavy on themes, and the most interesting Kubrick film (directing wise).",fullmetaljacket
"An excellent war film that is basically two stories. First half deals with some very intense and at times humorous depictions of the training, while the second half is dark and full of war time scenes. Full Metal Jacket covers a very interesting perspective of the military",fullmetaljacket
"Dark, disturbing and intense. I was not watching movie. In the first 45 minutes of the movie, I was in the recruit training with the soldiers. The performance is astonishing. The insults are damn hysterical. I love them so much. Overall, Full Metal Jacket is a well-made war film.",fullmetaljacket
"During a relentless boot camp followed by a few tense scenes in Vietnam, we watch a handful of soldiers try to cope and stay upbeat through some pretty dark experiences.",fullmetaljacket
The sudden transition from basic training to real combat is a welcome change to the war movie narrative. Typically great direction and camera work. R. Lee Ermey steals the show with his legendary improv.,fullmetaljacket
"Stanley Kubrick dark humour and coherent storytelling, brilliantly depicted the ""war is hell"" genre that felt more like a documentary than a fictional-style film. Full Metal Jacket is about a group of soldiers who turn into killers in marine training, and are then sent off to the Vietnam War. Though it is predictable, the message is compelling, intense and uneasy to watch.",fullmetaljacket
"While I personally prefer Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket still has cinematography and dialogue that rival Coppola's film, and the film is still very well acted across all fronts. The war scenes were excellent. Full Metal Jacket is probably my second favorite war film now. Verdict: A+",fullmetaljacket
"Eye catching and outstanding performance from R Lee Ermey. Some human close up shots remind you of the Shining, may be that's Kubrick's favorite way to show the devil within.",fullmetaljacket
"to the 6% of you who didn't like this film I ask to explain why 6% replies, ""sir I..."" ""sir what? were you about to call me an asshole?!""",fullmetaljacket
"While not Stanley Kubrick's strongest work, Full Metal Jacket is an intense, darkly humorous, and deeply profound investigation on the Vietnam War through the eyes of a pair of Marine volunteers",fullmetaljacket
"It's really too bad that the second section of the film doesn't contain as driving a plot as the first section. I enjoyed seeing the themes from one flow into the other, but the films progression slows down to almost a standstill. Still a brilliant work by Kubrick, but it could have been improved.",fullmetaljacket
"Me so horny. Me so horny. Me love you long time. We follow Private Joker through an intense boot camp where one recruit struggles to meet the requirements. Joker takes on a military profession as a journalist where he interviews soldiers and sees limited live action; however, we may see Joker report under live fire when a surprise attack hits the Americans hard. ""What is your major malfunction, numb-nuts? Didn't mommy and daddy show you enough affection as a child?"" Stanley Kubrick, director of A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Eyes Wide Shut, Barry Lyndon, and the Killing, delivers Full Metal Jacket. The storyline for this is so well written and the dialogue and intensity is perfect. The action scenes are well done but it is the interactions between characters that make this film work. The cast delivers awesome performances and includes Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin, Arliss Howard, and John Terry. ""Here you are, all equally worthless."" I swore I had written a review for this already, but when I saw it wasn't on here I grabbed it off HBOGO. This is an all time classic and my favorite military genre film. The boot camp scenes were so good and well done. I adore just about everything about this film and it is a must see. ""Sound off like you have a pair!"" Grade: A+",fullmetaljacket
"Even though Full Metal Jacket was made in 1987, Director Stanley Kubrick had already been around for a long time--for example, he's known for filming the largely satirical Dr. Strangelove in the early 60s. His filming ingenuity only got better as time went on, and Full Metal Jacket is proof of this fact. In this movie, Kubrick relied heavily on a soundtrack to tell the narrative through the technique of satire. I believe that this soundtrack is used to establish an ironical relationship between the audience and the characters in the movie. In other words, Kubrick uses the soundtrack as an ironic plot device. For example, the choice to use ""The Chapel of Love"" while the men are at war serves to either make fun of or emphasize the desperate attitudes of some of the soldiers experiencing post-traumatic stress. In other words, the movie indirectly makes fun of steadfast patriotism when war instead really promises mental insanity.",fullmetaljacket
I have heard from several Vietnam war vets that this is the most accurate of all films that cover the war. Chronicles the journey of one young man from boot camp through the war and does so in very uncomfortable fashion. A true classic by the impeccable Stanley Kubrick.,fullmetaljacket
"So beautiful. Funny at parts. If every director were like Kubrick, people would love movies more. This work of art is about the war in Vietnam and the training that marines have to endure. Training involves physical abuse, as well as mental when Sgt. Hartman humiliates and teaches his future marines to master their guns and build a disregard for human life in the battle. The movie is not only quotable, but it is THE war film. If you still think that war is collecting coins after you shoot people on a battleground, watch this and get proven wrong. Seriously, though. Watch this. And we'll talk about it.",fullmetaljacket
"THIS CLASSIC 1987 WAR FILM IS NOW A COMPANION-PIECE TO ""AMERICAN SNIPER"" (2014). STANLEY KUBRICK'S HARROWING MASTERPIECE EXPOSES THE DANGERS OF BASIC TRAINING. SOLDIERS CAN GO THROUGH HELL...BEFORE THEY REACH THE WAR ZONE.",fullmetaljacket
Watched it for the first time at the Kubrick retrospective at the Lightbox. It stands up really well to time. The filmmaking is still innovative. The themes many. The characters reflective and real. You could probably swap out Vietnam for the Afghanistan or Iraq and not skip a beat.,fullmetaljacket
"One of Kubrick's best films. A very intense and some times dark plot that sets it apart from many of the Vietnam War films of the day. One of the best looks at boot- camp in a film. Stellar performances from Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio and R. Lee Ermey.",fullmetaljacket
"Excellent excellent movie portraying the ways of war. With the Vietnamese girl getting raped and killed, that was the darkest part of the movie for me. Not to mention behavior unbecoming of a soldier and breaking the rules of war. I could watch this movie over and over again. Love it!!!!!",fullmetaljacket
"One of the greatest wars film for it's time. With a great performance by R. Lee Ermey, memorable lines, and a great story. The first half is worth the price of admission alone. Full Metal Jacket gets the final prop rating of 5 Jelly Doughnuts.",fullmetaljacket
"Of all Kubrick's films I have to admit this being probably my least favorite. I'm not sure exactly why, perhaps it's the subject matter, but it just didn't have the same impact on me as most of his other movies. It's an accomplished piece of film-making, that almost goes without saying of course, and R Lee Ermey's performance is outstanding, but overall I wasn't as engaged, and felt unable to get too emotionally involved with any of the characters. Because it's a Kubrick picture I must admit I almost felt slight guilt, like it was a failing on my part, perhaps I was missing something? His films do tend to grow on you, so another viewing might be in order at some point, and maybe then I'll be swayed. 6/10",fullmetaljacket
"Stanley Kubrick's return after a seven year hiatus, is this excellent war drama which follows raw recruits of volunteers in the US marine corps. The film is structured into two distinct sections, the first showing their training by a hard as nails Sgt., before plunging our characters right in the middle of the Vietnam war. Excellently written, produced & directed Kubrick doesn't disappoint in entertaing his audience. The film also features great performances from its then largely unknown cast.",fullmetaljacket
"It's not quite on the level of Kubrick's absolute best, but the messages it has about war and some of the performances throughout are good enough to make you sit up and watch. Full review later.",fullmetaljacket
"This Vietnam war film has a flawless first-half. The scenes at the boot camp are classic and hilarious. The second half drops off a bit, but the film is still brilliant overall. One of Kubrick's best films for sure.",fullmetaljacket
"Dark humor, sharp dialogue and R. Lee Ermey's terrifyingly excellent performance. Full Metal Jacket is a gripping portrayal of the dehumanization and transformation of the US soldier in the midst of the Vietnam War. Kubrick's tactical direction and nasty-good production on this film is one of his best. 5/5",fullmetaljacket
"Review In A Nutshell: When we think of war, the images that come to our head are the smoke that slowly breathes out of a fired rifle, the red blood that stains the green uniform, the flash of an exploding grenade; these are dark images that fill the puzzle of war's brutality and horror, but what these images do not show is the horrors that lurk underneath; the human spirit fractured in order to fulfil their duty as soldiers. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket stands along with films like Apocalypse Now, The Thin Red Line, and Paths of Glory where war is seen through the eyes of the soldiers and how their experiences have affected them internally; the unseen soul. The film begins with the sight of men sitting down and having their hair shaved completely off with faces of both sadness and uncertainty. It is the U.S. Marine's first step in attempting to take what is most precious of them, their identities. It is the idea that each and every one of these soldiers will be identical fighting machines, despite the drill instructor denying this, to strip them completely of what they were and instil a new perspective on yourself, your brothers, and your enemies. The film then takes us to the intimidating introduction of their drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman, a man who response only to sheer volume and intensity, constantly searching for flaws and anomalies in the soldiers' systems and destroying them little by little. This is also where we get to see these soldiers further lose themselves, through the replacement of their names with nicknames that are far from who they really are, aside from maybe Joker, whom which probably impressed the Sergeant despite his disrespect. During this introduction is also the time where the audience is formally introduced to Leonard Lawrence, who is better known in the camp as Gomer Pyle, as a connection to his inherent dimwittedness and innocence; he becomes the Sergeant immediate target because he knows Gomes Pyle is not right for the corps but since he is already present and unlikely to quit, he has to do the best he can to push him to his highest limits. Gomer Pyle's journey through the training is one of the most terrifying experiences I have ever seen, showing how a fresh young face could fall so low in human spirit; a soul that has suffered psychological and emotional torment, betrayal from his once loyal and respected brothers, having to endure demanding and straining physical training, it all adds up in shaping what he would ultimately become, a soulless monster. The end of this half delivered one of the most gasping moments of the entire film, the bathroom massacre. A slow moving Joker flashes his light on Gomer Pyle, revealing him in possession of a live cartridge that is then locked and loaded into his rifle. It is clear that the training he has endured has pushed him too far, deprived of happiness and consciousness, knowing only his duty as a marine corps, to kill. It is the horrifying image of his wicked stare that shivers the audience's bones, not the loaded rifle itself; it is the idea that he has gone too far to find salvation, and it was only in the sound of his once precious name that a glimmer came to his eye and decides to end himself once and for all, sparing Joker's life. It is a moment that stays with you long after the film ends, reminding you of the many Gopher Pyles out there walking and causing pain to those undeserving of it. The second half of the film then turns to the big stage, Vietnam and the war that deeply affected everyone that took part in it. It still follows in the eyes of Joker who works as a correspondent for an American newspaper, Stars and Stripes, which aimed to report news, boost soldier morale, and sway the minds of those unconvinced of America's involvement in the war; it is an element that Kubrick only covers minimally, but hearing it spoke volumes to me; displaying more of what the war really is, without having to actually show it. It would have been fantastic if Kubrick further covered it. After a suicide squad attempting to infiltrate their base, Joker was assigned to the ""shit"" with his photographer Rafterman, and from there we experience the true nature of soldier warfare; the unpredictability, the paranoia, the destruction that surrounds them, all coming to together to slowly destroy the innocent mind of our protagonist; a person who had a sense of balance, surviving the war with killing in his head, ""Born to Kill"", and forgiveness in his heart, the peace symbol, retaining that part of himself that keeps him sane. The film subtly throughout this half, question the true agenda of the soldier's stay in Vietnam, told from the perspective of the soldiers themselves through documentary-like interviews that show honest and thoughtful responses. The film then leads to a gripping climax of a sniper picking off their platoon, one by one. It is a tense situation that ends with harrowing imagery. It is revealed that the sniper is just a young girl, and through this Kubrick scares us with the idea that children were raised and trained in order to fight for their causes, youth losing its innocence far too early, wanting her life to end rather than ask for medical attention; it is a frightening scene that shows just how damaged our world is. Ending the film, is a slightly touching scene of soldiers marching in the night, singing out loud a song from their beloved childhood; holding tight a piece of themselves in order to get through god-awful war. Full Metal Jacket may not be the most obvious film in regards to Kubrick's sense of visual and audible flair, but the film's grounded visual take on the war is meaningful and terrifying. During the film's first half, it captures the uniform and tightness of military training, a zone where anarchy and natural movements are absent. During interior scenes, we get a layer of darkness that connects with the gradual loss of the souls of its subjects, coming off more like a mental asylum rather than a barrack; very few films could capture this without becoming too stylish in its imagery. The second half of the film opens up with a larger canvas, displaying the destructive conditions of the war; with sights of crumbling buildings, flaming interiors, and abundance of dirt. The film still manages to be a spectacle without forgetting the film's most important subjects, the characters. The second half spends a fair amount of time with the camera closer to the ground, along the feet of the soldiers, like as if we were trying to take cover from enemy fire, a paranoia of having our heads stand too high; it maintains a sense of uneasiness that correlates with the emotions of its characters. Kubrick almost strips the whole film with vibrant colours, keeping the film feeling deathly and soul crushing; pushing dark greens and dusty browns, the colours that immediately bring to mind the conditions of war. The haunting score by Vivian Kubrick, under the alias of Abigail Mead, dominates the film's scenes through generating dark and atmospheric emotions that elevate the film's themes and tension; just listen to the rumbling seedy tones during the bathroom massacre. The same goes for the sniper sequence, with music that crawls under our skin and feeds dark and fracturing emotions. The combination of Kubrick's score and Americana soundtrack gave the film that sense of balance and flavour, coming off as different from the other films that cover the same ground; it never tries to over-dramatize its scenes, instead the score reaches for the darker depths of the film's characters without drama elevation, while the soundtracks are present to create a hilarious satire of America's presence in the war. Matthew Modine is the film's protagonist, Private Joker, but I felt his performance was a bit underwhelming as compared to others that have led in a Kubrick film; the writing certainly makes his role feel interesting but his performance rarely ever elevates it. The shining star in this film is an actor who only appears during the first half of the film, and that is Vincent D'Onofrio playing as Gomer Pyle; a transformational performance that captures the essence of his character perfectly. Full Metal Jacket is an example of a war film attempting to be more than what it plainly is; it showcases the inherent nature of war and its effects on the human mind and soul. It tells a story that is not restricted by a conventional three act approach, and it features a stand out performance from D'Onofrio as the lovable turned deadly, Gomer Pyle. I think I'm going to love this film for a long time.",fullmetaljacket
"Out-freaking-standing Vietnam war film! Just can't wait to go back home & watch another one of Kubrick's work, the 2001: Space Odyssey. Interstellar is said to be the 21st Century version of that old Sci-Fi Classic. Tis' among the best war films that I've seen thus far. My list of the finest includes Saving Private Ryan, Born On The Fourth of July, The Hurt Locker & Black Hawk Down.",fullmetaljacket
"The way the story was told was quite odd to me; done in only two acts? Odd, something the a-hole nit-picky side of me could'nt help but notice. But aside from that, this movie has a morbid and dehumanizing humor to it as many other reviewers here have stated.",fullmetaljacket
"Absolutely brilliant war film with amazing scenery, only bad thing is that it went too quickly, I would have liked the film to be a bit longer to add a bit more to the story. A classic though, no doubt about that!",fullmetaljacket
"Kubrick is a genius, Well the intention was clear. Full metal jacket was extremely Intense and darkly funny at times. It gives a time to think about how pointless these wars are. One of the best war films ever made.",fullmetaljacket
"Well constructed, thrilling, surprisingly comedic, and abruptly violent. Stanley Kubrick weaves another tightly knitted film that is as affecting as it is gripping. Grade: A-",fullmetaljacket
"Tough call; a thoroughly enjoyable and well crafted film, if not a little familiar. The thing is, Kubrick doesn't succeed in developing any characters. Yes, the point is they are trained to be machines, but we never connected to their pre-machine selves. It's really tough to care about any death when you don't feel for anyone. I love both acts, but they don't play off of each other well enough. Still one of the best nam films.",fullmetaljacket
"Let me say, the first forty five minutes of this film, is some of my favorite bits of film in history. Cutting there and it would have been the absolute best short film ever made. Then the second half happens. Now it's not bad, the last ten minutes are just as griping as the first forty five, but I have never been too invested in the bits between then. I still completely recommend this film to anyone who loves films and filmmaking, but that little bit is enough to keep me from giving it a higher place up there in the pantheon of cinema.",fullmetaljacket
"Director Stanley Kubrick done some nice explorations in his projects. He'd explored space with systematic corruption and boredom, and the insane, hysteric horror of a human mind and condition. Both of those are his 3.5-star masterpieces. His best work belongs to the battlefield of the war genre. In that field he'd explored the consequences of stopping yourself from following commands and get framed and shot for cowering, and the satiric reason why we need to learn to ""stop worrying and love the bomb."" Now before his final project of ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" he returned to the battlefield one more time to add another the story to the chronicles of the Vietnam War, and it'd resulted to be his best masterpiece. ""Full Metal Jacket"" explores the process of a new recruit entering from boot camp to the battlefields in the U.S. Marine Corps. The first 20 minutes were the recruits' training period. It was a masterful exposition with the cast only saying things that are around under the category of ""Sir, yes sir!"" to R. Lee Ermey's not-so fictional character when he was a drill instructor at that time the film takes place. He stands out and shines the most out of the cast when his performance is so good that it's probably the best of the film. He was also expressing a theme with a message to be analyzed and he had Vincent D'Onofrio as his volunteer to help out that message to the unfortunate outcome: D'Onofrio's character was mirroring a bit of how Jack Nicholson's character gone through in ""The Shining,"" but by the subject of the expressed theme of hypocrite bullying. Now for the main story that'd took the next 93 minutes was the main setting: fighting in the war on tour. Matthew Modine's character James Davis is the story's narrator going over how haunting and violent the Vietnam War can from what he'd experienced from commander of the recruits with a thirst to see combat to ""later becomes an independent-minded combat correspondent."" We'll be soon get in combat side-by-side with his old comrades from Sergeant Hartman's (R. Lee Ermey) boot camp, when he's nicknamed the Joker - representing some of the film's occasional light-hearted humor. The way how Davis's experiences in the war were constructed in the film was nicely done as usual in the war genre. The effects of combat, including the power and energy from the actors pretending/acting like they're in the war, and the performances are what a war flick reload to keep the power going. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a nice addition to the Vietnam War chronicles with the usual qualities at their efforts to match the pounding of a war's battlefield, making this war drama Kubrick's best masterful work in exploring more in the process of serving a war while at the same time rarely reminiscing few of his past explorations, with stuff to express. (B+)",fullmetaljacket
"Skv?lé vále?né drama. Dva p?íb?hy, jeden z výcviku, druhý z akce vietnamské války. Syrov? podané, i kdy na za?átku jsem m?l pocit, e to snad bude komedie. Kubrick umí.",fullmetaljacket
"It is excellently filmed and superbly crafted technically, but the deliberate narrative shift in the middle is jarring and gives a horribly overbearing feeling of disjointedness to the film. That said the first 45 minutes or so contain some of the most powerful psycho-analytical scenes ever committed to celluloid.",fullmetaljacket
"It's first half is definitely stronger than its second half, Kubrick clearly a bit out of his element filming combat zones encumbered by some awkward dialogue, but the entire film is a remarkably effective indictment of the Vietnam War and the destruction of youth by the U.S. military industrial complex. The hoo-rah Marine Corps mystique comes under fire in particular, with a stunning analysis of the mental and emotional breakdown of recruits at Paris Island, with some harrowing twists and turns (fired by a remarkable depiction of drill sergeants). The Vietnam act suffers from Kubrick's obvious struggle in effectively filming combat zones and firefights, but his narrative is constructed so well in its bleakness and despair that it doesn't matter too much. Juxtaposition of period rock music is unsettling as well. An excellent example of an anti-war-film-film, it may not quite reach the heights of ""The Thin Red Line"" in deconstruction of the genre, but it doesn't fall short by that much. Necessary viewing for those who seriously want to consider the dehumanizing nature of war.",fullmetaljacket
Really really great. The acting was impressive along with the storyline. And the perfect amount of humor lined in this drama. Plus the music was unreal a great add on.,fullmetaljacket
"My full opinion: Full Metal Jacket is a violent, but darkly comic war movie, that features one of my favorite screenplay, outrageous performances, and of course, an amazing storytelling. 9.9/10",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket is undoubtedly the finest war film I have ever seen. Startlingly authentic and deeply intimate, the film is carried by a sharp screenplay, spectacular direction and some bravoes performances. The first 45 minutes - the story of Staff Sergeant Hartman and Private Pyle (both played to Oscar-worthy glory by Ermey and D'Onofrio) - is a flawless masterpiece. Kubrick's direction is masterful, and there are moments in this film that I can point to to say ""greatest director of all time.""",fullmetaljacket
"One of the greatest film on Vietnam war, standing next to one and only Coppola's Apocalypse Now. You cant define these type of films in just few words. Each and every details have lot to speak for themselves. Its a never-to-be-told experience.",fullmetaljacket
"Near perfect war movie. Might be my favourite war movie it's right up there with the likes of platoon and other greats. Ermey is great as the sergeant and the first half of the movie is perfect. The second half drops a bit in quality, but the action scenes were good. The improvisation was great at the beginning and Stanley Kubrick makes the film look great. It definitely looks and feels like a Kubrick film to me. Well worth a watch.",fullmetaljacket
"The brutality & senselessness of war is brilliantly beautiful shown thru the eyes of the masterful Kubrick. This film is chock full of memorable & colorful obscenities which adds levity to the slow dehumanization of boys becoming marines. But war is not a game, as these boys tragically discover. War is Hell indeed.",fullmetaljacket
"Tighter than ""Eyes Wide Shut"", Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" is an almost impeccable war movie, highlighting the intense brutality and nearly emotionless action that goes into the training of Marines going into Vietnam. The movie is very difficult to watch, so entertaining it is not. But important? I'd say so. Though moments tend to drag here and there, Kubrick contributes his signature vision to the film that exists in all of his work and differentiates him as one of the greats. The acting is fine here as well, most notably that of R. Lee Ermey as the drill sergeant from Hell and Vincent D'Onofrio as the Marine trainee who undergoes a seriously frightening mental breakdown (the bathroom scene is impossible to forget).",fullmetaljacket
"Kubrick always had a cold detachment. Whether it be focusing on the exploitation of soldiers from their peers in ""Paths of Glory"" or laughing to the nuclear gallows with ""Dr. Strangelove,"" it was obvious that Kubrick preferred cynicism over warmth. 'Full Metal Jacket' most certainly follows Kubrick's cynical perception, a movie that reflects the Marine Corps deconstruction of the human being to become a natural born killer. Thematically, Kubrick's anti-war message is one that has been told time and time again. However, and with the help of the hilarious Sergeant Hartman (Ermey) - a character that continually shouts disgusting simile's and metaphors that creates an enjoyable balance of dark humour - Kubrick's deliverance of this recycled message is undeniably riveting. Besides Ermey's performance, Kubrick's ability as craftsman most certainly elevates the somewhat tiresome material. Not only is the direction spot on but also the meticulous touches to the lighting and music that contribute to overall harrowing affect (especially during the sequence where Pyle commits suicide; the lighting, the direction and music all combine perfectly to reflect the descent into violent madness). However, while these themes are portrayed with power, there are times where you feel Kubrick is being too cynical or simply too simplistic. Surely all Marine Corps are not systematic to point that there is no room for some gesture of humour or characterization? I know Kubrick is representing the deconstruction of humane qualities contributed from war, but such a focus makes the story at times rather dull (this is quite noticeable in the second half with the spark of the Ermey missing and the audience are left with a group of uninteresting cold-blooded killing machines). Besides these shortcomings in the second half, Kubrick's direction of Nam's battlefields are once again riveting. Revisiting the tracking shots he adopted in 'Paths of Glory,' Kubrick places the camera in a position so the audience are invited into the films battle depictions against the backdrop of the beautiful destructive scenery. Rather than giving the audience the benefit of an omnipresent vision, Kubrick situates the audience in the soldiers position which creates a realistic feel that many war films seem to lack. Fundamentally, while Kubrick's vision at times is too cynical, ""Full Metal Jacket"" features a great amount of enjoyable black humour and a craftsman at the top of his game.",fullmetaljacket
"An awesome badass movie with unforgettably great acting from R. Lee Ermey and classic memorable quotes. This was interesting to watch as I compared it to Born on the Fourth of July and Apocalypse Now as those films involved with the same war. I loved the different direction that Stanley Kubrick chose to make this film. All in all, I loved it, it was fun, exciting, and really not boring at all. Watch this film soon. FRESH",fullmetaljacket
"Well, I hate to admit it, but this film just convinces me that I'm NOT a Stanley Kubrick fan. There's a huge list of films of his that I didn't like,including ""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""The Shinning"", ""2001"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"", just to name a few. For me they were all snore fests as is ""Full Metal Jacket"". Granted it has great performances, but that just doesn't cut it for me.",fullmetaljacket
"The movie does a good job at showing the horrors of war by stripping it down to the core and stripping away some of the characters humanity. The movie fun to watch, funny dark and thought provoking and no one else could've made this movie any better.",fullmetaljacket
"Stanley Kubrick knows well how to satisfy both critics and audience, and after a seven-year hiatus, he delivers a marvelous picture about the different aspects of war.",fullmetaljacket
"Darkly comic, nihilistic, Violent. Full Metal Jacket is a war film that shows the darker side of war. That some soldiers get a thrill from killing another human being. It's easily the most nihilistic war film ever made, and made by none other then the legend Stanley Kubrick.",fullmetaljacket
"Although I've seen a lot of war movies, its not a genre I enjoy watching. However , Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is certainly one of my fav. war movies along with The Hurt Locker and probably The Pianist. What all these movies have in common is that, although they show a broad perspective of war, they have memorable characters who really bring emotions to this movie. But even setting these aside, Full Metal Jacket never really starts from a war perspective. It starts with the scrutinizing life under a drill sergeant(incredible performance by R. Lee Ermey) and slowly eases into the war scene. However even during war, the scenes slowly eases into the heart of the war. The cinematography is beautiful and if you notice, most of the shots have been taken during the golden hour where the best lighting for films are possible. This style really contrasts with the themes in the film which really brings up new emotions under this genre. Its something which only someone like Kubrick could bring about. The acting was also filled with great performances unlike the normal forgettable war film faces. Especially the first 45mins were absolutely remarkable.",fullmetaljacket
"Second only to Coppola's masterful ""Apocalypse Now"", Kubrick's examination of the Vietnam war chronicals the lifespan of a killer manufactured by a government and an army that, under all its swagger and bravado and iconography, is simply engaged in a systemic indoctrination of human beings into the cult of death, blind patriotism, brutality, violence, and horror resulting in inhuman insanity to protect its own interests. The fact that it's hilarious is just icing on the cake.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket is a simple film. Easy to follow with no heavy narrative involved, this Kubrick war drama opens your eyes to what war is really like. The film is separated into two acts. The first act shows the U.S. Marines going through boot camp with an amazing ad-libbed performance by R. Lee Ermey that has to be seen to be believed. Following the shocking conclusion to this part, you are taken into battle with Pvt. 'Joker' Davis, played here well by Matthew Modine. There is no real major story featured. It simply shows you what a normal (and bloody) day these men went through during the Vietnam war. This is what makes it enjoyable. With nothing to try and work out, you can simply sit back and enjoy it. What also adds to the experience is the recreation of the Vietnam war zone. Surprisingly filmed completely in England, so much work has been put into making it look perfect that you would actually wonder at times if they shipped their actors out to Vietnam. A good cast, a good soundtrack and a fun time makes this a film worth watching.",fullmetaljacket
"""THE VIETNAM WAR"" - 'Full Metal Jacket' is a 1987 war film directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick (The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut). The film is based on the novel 'The Short Timers' by Gustaph Hasford and portraits the training and actual combat action of some young marines during the Vietnam War. Kubrick is a master in storytelling by showing hard facts mixed with well-chosen music. A couple of scenes will be glued to your memory. This 'Full Metal Jacket' is a must-see classic. Starring Matthew Modine (The Transporter 2, Weeds), Adam Baldwin (Predator 2, Independence Day), Vincint D'Onofrio (Men in Black, The Cell) and R. Lee Ermey (The Texas Chainsaw remakes, Willard). 1967, Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (Ermey) trains a load of U.S. Marine Corps recruits in their boot camp. His iron fist will discipline the boys. One of them is James Davis (Modine), who is given the nickname 'Joker'. He dares to take a stand and considered to be in charge of his fellow recruits. Another is the clumsy overweight Leonard Lawrence (D'Onofrio) who earns the nickname 'Gomer Pyle'. He suffers the most from Hartman's boot camp training. With some help from 'Joker', he does seem to improve. But when Hartman discovers that 'Gomer Pyle' has stashed away a jelly doughnut: the whole squad is punished for his deeds... The following year, 'Joker' has become a war correspondent at the Vietnam War. When the Tet Offensive kicks in, he joins a platoon of Marines on a deadly mission. There he sees one of his of boot camp mates and meets machine gunner 'Animal Mother' (Baldwin). Will they live to tell the tale?",fullmetaljacket
"First 45 minutes was war movie gold. The drill sergeant was one of my favorite war movie characters ever. After that it was mediocre, still loved the movie though",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket almost feels like two small films put together. Many claim that its post-boot-camp section is not as effective as the former. Although this is true, the second half also carries a lot of weight, and the ending is very impressive.",fullmetaljacket
"If it weren't for R. Lee Ermey's role, I might never have given this film much of a chance, regardless of the esteemed director navigating it.",fullmetaljacket
"22/30 Full Metal Jacket begins within brilliance and ends on nothing - or rather a cliché, which is worse than nothing. Or perhaps I'm getting a bit too cynical about war film. Still, it has some merits.",fullmetaljacket
"It's hardcore violent, hillarious in the darkest way, and features talented actors. Full Metal Jacket is split into two amazing segments, and has incredibly menacing characters, and intense action sequences. Full Metal Jacket is one of the great war movies, and Kubrick's fine direction sums it all up.",fullmetaljacket
"War movies there are many. But Kubrick obviously stands out as one of the best as it offers a fairly harsh, soulful and critical movie that revolves around soldiers and the vietnam war. The movie is filled with great commentary about war and the military and every scene feels carefully created and skilfully written and directed thanks to Kubricks nearly endless experience in the industry.",fullmetaljacket
"75% Saw this on 18/04/2014 Actually after watching this film, I wondered why the people call it such a tremendous movie. I don't mean that it's bad, it's all right, but not any different from any of the other usual war films. The first half is good with some fine acting and drama, but the character development is poor. The second half is mostly tiring and the climax is not bad, but not as good as the first half. The slow motion scenes are good.",fullmetaljacket
"The first half of the movie is a gripping tale, from the time the boys join the training till Lawrence killing the Sgt. Hartman. The rest is a usual war movie drama with interesting characters and rampant killings.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket was one of the last films directed by Stanley Kubrick, and while it isn't his greatest, it has definitely earned it's praise. The film takes place during the Vietnam War, with the first half focusing on basic training and the second half on the soldier's experiences in Vietnam. The first half is really where the film shines, having a clear message with so very humorous insults from R. Lee Ermey (who was a real-life drill instructor). When the film switches over to Vietnam, however, the film gradually goes downhill. There are a bunch of little short segments, most of them not being important to the story at all, but there are so truly great moments, especially the helicopter scene. Also, alll of the battle scenes are extremely well done, especially the final battle between the soldiers and the sniper. Full Metal Jacket isn't a perfect film, especially with it's disappointing second half, but it's truly great scenes mostly make up for this.",fullmetaljacket
Stanley Kubrick's classic war movie has resonating and thought provoking ideas and has a realistic vibe that makes it worthy of a recommendation. It also has gritty moments and impressive performances that are very impressive. There are slow parts in the middle that seem to drag on but it somewhat adds to the realism of the film. The finale of this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and the film's psychological ideas are bound to spark lots of discussion.,fullmetaljacket
"This Film May Not Be The Greatest Kubrick Film But It Certainly Is The Only Vietnam Film To Go All Comic On Us Thats A Really Hard Job To Do And Kubrick Pulled It Off Nicely Its Also Makes Me Forget That Im Watching A Kubrick Film And Watching Something That Francis Ford Coppola Would Make But He Did Another Vietnam Film That Didn't Have Any Dark Humor And Was Way More Darker And Brutally Honest, But This Film Still Has Its Own Style With The Amazing Direction Of Stanley Kubrick!",fullmetaljacket
"Second half isn't that interesting, but this is undoubtedly a Stanley Kubrick masterpiece. Based off The Short-Timers, a semi-autobiographical book by Gustav Hasford, Full Metal Jacket follows a US Marine platoon going through training, later transitioning its focus to two Marines of the platoon in the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam War. The film does tons of detail exploring the steps that are taken into becoming a Marine, including following orders correctly, moving through obstacles quickly and flawlessly, remaining organized, preparing weapons correctly, and remaining close to the squad the soldier is assigned to. The film, like many masterful war films, uses tons of graphic violence and personal conflict in order to add realism and humanity to the story in order to prevent Full Metal Jacket from going into generic war film territory. Stanley Kubrick uses his unbelievable genius to craft a film that says ""war"". He does an incredible job by giving audiences heart breaking battle sequences that also shock them rather than entertain them (thank God, because war is disgraceful). Kubrick, Michael Herr, and author Hasford craft a script that expands Part I, and contains elements of Part II and III, yet omits Part III. Part II isn't that engaging or as interesting or psychologically disturbing as Part I, but is still a key element to the story, even if it's message isn't that great. The acting is stellar, most particularly R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a ruthless, mean, foul-mouthed drill instructor who actually was played by a US Marine drill instructor who was in service during the Vietnam War, and Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence, an overweight, clumsy, incompetent, slow-witted recruit who in fact becomes the focus for Sergeant Hartman for his flaws. In fact, R. Lee Ermey's scene where he chewed out the new recruits was mostly improvised, despite the fact that Kubrick never allowed his actors to improvise, although he allowed a few to do that, R. Lee Ermey's being one of them, which helped show off the brutality of his character, especially to D'Onofrio's Pyle. In fact, this scene should've gotten him an Oscar nod, same goes for D'Onofrio. Vincent is able to capture the recruit going from a troubled man, to an insane, creepy, and flawless recruit whose unpredictable in every corner. The change in D'Onofrio's character shows that people can change even before they go to war (nonviolence anyone?), and that training can have negative implications in them and/or their platoon. A must-see, especially for anyone who's against war.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket is a brutal, intense, bloody, disturbing and occasionally comedic movie. It's not the greatest war film or the most original, but it's one of the darkest and most frightening of them all.",fullmetaljacket
"Kubrick's best film in my opinion, FMJ delivers the goods: it has action, war, drama, and a verbally abusive drill sergeant whose lines will remain as some of the best movie quotes of all time.",fullmetaljacket
"The story follows a few recruits at camp before they are shipped out to war. The first part is almost a comedy of sorts until it takes a dark turn late and they get shipped out to war. The tone changes a bit and it feels more like a documentary of sorts where the soldiers don't really know why they are there, but do it anyways. They go on a mission where they find a sniper who pins them down so they must find a way to survive before they are all killed. A pretty interesting movie, felt the first half was a little more interesting and moved along better and the second half wandered around just a little too much before ending abruptly. I did enjoy it, but not as much as I thought given the film's recommendations.",fullmetaljacket
One of the best war movies ever. Stanley Kubrick follows Mathew Modine's character from Paris Island to Vietnam. Real feel to the action. Vincent O'nofrio is fantastic as a new recruit along with R. Lee Ermey as the Training Sergeant.,fullmetaljacket
"Like other Stanley Kubrick movies, Full Metal Jacket was great! Finally, another humorous take on the Vietnam War. But the film was also intense and thought-provoking. And like The Shining, Kubrick builds suspense and looks into the minds of soldiers and cadets. Full Metal Jacket is one of the most visually arresting, humorous,effective, and violent looks at War at the 'Nam I have ever seen.",fullmetaljacket
Was actually disappointed after seeing this for the first time recently. The brilliant boot camp lead up never paid off in the war end of the movie in my opinion.,fullmetaljacket
"The entire movie is fantastic, but the first forty five minutes are legendary!!! THIS IS MY RIFLE THIS IS MY GUN, THIS IS FIGHTING THIS IS FOR FUN!!!",fullmetaljacket
"As Kubrick made his way toward the 90's, it became clear that he was attempting to alternate between genres of source material. Full Metal Jacket proves this maneuver successful. Kubrick's ability to blend moods, specifically within the first 40 minutes, is at an all time high, presenting to us some hilarious yet intense drill instructing from the one and only R. Lee Ermey. On a deeper level, it illustrates the complete deterioration of the troops in the Marine corps to the point of losing their last remaining shreds of humanity, leaving them lifeless, killer husks. This is displayed by Kubrick in his signature intensity and terror that no other horror flick can bring to the script and screen.",fullmetaljacket
"Great anti war film about the Vietnam war. It follows the Vietnam war theme of the time and compares favorably with the rest, but it isn't the best one. I haven't seen all the Vietnam movies of the time, I have yet to see Apocolips Now, but I think this will be one of the better ones. My favorite Vietnam movie is We Were Soldiers, second is Hamburger Hill, and although this movies good, it dosent come close to them in my opinion. The first half of the movie at boot camp was not as good as I expected, and kinda let me down although it was funny, but the second half made up for that. It shows how inhumane war turns soldiers, and is graphic and suspenseful. But the acting isn't great, some lines are poorly written and some things are overdone. Also I didn't like the scenes where they shoot at the buildings because of how the whole 4 story wall of the building would seem to explode in dust and exploding shells. And thats not the only thing that largely exaggerated. Not the best Vietnam war movie but pretty good, and it nice that it includes a rural battle setting, which is a good change from other Vietnam war films.",fullmetaljacket
"My favorite war movie and favorite movie up there with the first three Die Hard's and A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's Stanley Kubrick's best movie as well. It's a great tale the follows the story of a few marines and shows the true horrors of war with a dark comedic tone. The acting is incredible and the war scenes are great and realistic. R. Lee Ermey was so believable in the role as a drill instructor...but that's because he use to be one and a lot of his lines are improvised. It's a truly haunting movie and once I tune in my focus never leaves the movie whenever I watch it. It's a truly compelling movie and I don't get why a lot of people say the second half ruins it, I think it adds a lot too it. The soundtrack too is great, especially during the war scenes, their not really what you'd expect to hear in a movie like this and it's just great. It's probably the most realistic Vietnam War movie of the 80's. It's a really great movie.",fullmetaljacket
"Full Metal Jacket is one of the greatest war films ever made, period. While exploring the horrors of war is nothing new, this film takes that simple idea and goes above and beyond that. It really takes the time to focus on the oddball cast of characters from basic training all the way up to conflicts in Vietnam, along with all the little things that happen during those times. The film portrays both the lighter, funnier sides of dark times, but also the grim and horrifying times in very effective ways. That's really not much more I can say about this film. It's a true classic in every way, and if you don't like it, well, to quote the film, ""CHOKE YOURSELF!"" Full Metal Jacket is required viewing for any film fanatic.",fullmetaljacket
"An absolute masterpiece. Stanley Kubrick proves once again that he is a master in cinema. This film is dark, brutal, and slightly funny. One of my favorite films, 5/5 a must watch",fullmetaljacket
"This movie is spectacular and deserves more. I wish that Maximus hasn't died because he was an excellent character and could've been great in the second movie, but other than that it has a good story with good characters and an great villain. This movie is definitely one of the best movies out there.",gladiator
"Je dois reconnaître que c’est un classique bien réalisé, avec une histoire poignante. Je ne suis cependant pas fan de l’univers des gladiateurs et de cette période historique qui est très sombre, j’ai donc mes réserves à ce niveau-là, bien le scénario apporte une certaine douceur.",gladiator
"Gladiator is a timeless epic that balances grandeur with raw emotion. Ridley Scott delivers a sweeping vision of ancient Rome, crafting battles that are both massive in scale and deeply personal. Russell Crowe gives one of his most iconic performances as Maximus, a tragic hero whose journey of vengeance and honor resonates just as powerfully today. Joaquin Phoenix’s Commodus is equally unforgettable, bringing menace and fragility to the role of a desperate emperor. Hans Zimmer’s haunting score lingers long after the credits, amplifying both the spectacle and the sorrow. While the pacing occasionally slows, the film’s emotional weight and visual mastery more than make up for it. For some, it’s a near-perfect film, for others, an untouchable masterpiece. Either way, Gladiator stands as one of cinema’s greatest achievements a film that redefined the modern epic and continues to captivate audiences decades later.",gladiator
Quite simply one of the best movies ever made. Acting: flawless. Story: superbe. Action scenes: edge-of-seat. Plot: instantly hooking. Characters: each and every single one has a clear function; each has their own clearly defined and complex personality. Music: hypnotising. Nothing left to chance. No loose ends. Just perfect story-telling. You will come back to this film again and again because of how it stays with you through sheer movie magic.,gladiator
"Maximus Decimus Meridius is one of the great movie characters because he embodies dignity in the face of betrayal. Russell Crowe gives him a commanding presence without ever overplaying it. He’s a general who becomes a slave, a slave who becomes a gladiator, and a gladiator who challenges an empire. He doesn’t seek revenge for its own sake. He acts out of loyalty to a murdered emperor and love for a family he’s lost. That combination of personal grief and unshakable honor gives Maximus a quiet power that defines every scene he’s in.",gladiator
"This is my favorite movie of all time. I love everything about this classic from start to finish. Saw it in the theatre twice when it was first released and watch it multiple times every year. Maybe another movie will beat it out as my favorite one day but not yet, not yet.",gladiator
"In 2025, I decided to fill one of the gaps in my life as a movie buff: watch the film Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe. I finally understood the critical and commercial acclaim the film garnered, in addition to, of course, its Oscar wins. The film's script is extremely well-constructed and makes us care about all the characters, especially the protagonist, whose development is one of the best I've ever seen. Ridley's direction is inspired, with memorable scenes in the Roman Colosseum. The cinematography is also a highlight, with scenes that resemble a painting, especially those highlighting the green fields, the mountainous landscape, and the blue sky. The soundtrack is memorable, and through it, we can sense the grandeur of the action and battles throughout the film. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a dangerous and multifaceted villain, who murdered his own father to declare himself Emperor of Rome and who courts his own sister in his desperate search for attention and devotion. I regret it took me so long to see this film, but no more so than not seeing it in theaters. In 2000, I was just a kid, and my film tastes were limited to Disney, Jurassic Park, and superhero movies. Those who were lucky enough, however, must have had an epic cinematic experience, which is what this film provides.",gladiator
"Gladiator is pure entertainment from start to finish. In a quintessential movie star performance, Russell Crowe brings charisma, sparkle, and depth to the stoic Maximus. He plays opposite an equally brilliant and disturbing Joaquin Phoenix. This film is a popcorn classic—a period piece featuring an impressive budget, elaborate sets, and outstanding stars.",gladiator
"Gladiator is more than just a historical epic — it’s a deeply human story about honor, vengeance, and legacy, brought to life through unforgettable performances and stunning craftsmanship. Ridley Scott’s direction is grand yet intimate, balancing sweeping battle sequences with quieter, emotional moments that give the film its soul. Russell Crowe delivers a commanding and heartfelt performance as Maximus, portraying a character driven by pain, principle, and purpose. Joaquin Phoenix, equally compelling, gives a chilling portrayal of corruption and weakness beneath power. The cinematography is gorgeous, the score by Hans Zimmer is iconic, and the storytelling is tight, immersive, and emotionally resonant. Even after all these years, Gladiator still feels fresh and relevant — a reminder of how powerful great filmmaking can be. Whether you’re watching it for the first time or the tenth, Gladiator never loses its impact. It earns its place as one of the greatest films of its genre.",gladiator
Absolutely loved it! And the best part? I got to experience it on the big screen for the very first time! What an epic way to watch a classic!,gladiator
"How can you not be entertained?! Ridley Scott’s sword-and-sandal epic is the catalyst that led to a majority of modern men’s obsession with the Roman Empire. The timeless, spectacular action combined with a simple yet poignant story makes this one of the prime examples of a blockbuster film at its best. Russell Crowe delivers a peak performance as the honorable hero, Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix matches Crowe’s excellence, playing the villainous foil, Commodus, a role that would launch him into stardom as well. While the gladiator combat is a major draw of the film, it’s the film’s exploration of societal power and the resilience of the human spirit that sets “Gladiator” apart from its many imitations.",gladiator
A brilliant film - breathtaking in its scope but also intimate in the portrayal of its characters. Every scene is a joy and Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are magnificent.,gladiator
"One of my top 3 favorite movies ever. The best history movie ever made. I watched this in theaters back in 2000,had the time of my life,and in the blink of an eye, 25 years have passed.",gladiator
"Severely underrated! This film is exceptional! The story, acting, cinematic elements etc etc are brilliant. Not to mention the beautiful soundtrack, that pulls on your emotions. A masterpiece",gladiator
"While entertaining and moving, Gladiator is trying to slay too many gladiators with one sword slash. While the character driven part of the story will keep the audiences engaged, the script falls flat in the world building department. Some plot holes may leave viewers puzzled.",gladiator
"ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?! This movie is an incredible historical fiction (sort of) revenge story. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Russel Crowe's performance was outstanding like always, and Joquain Phoenix portrayed a Caesar like no one else could.",gladiator
"Russell Crowe was built for this role. Even if you've never heard of the Romans, this is a brilliant and inspiring movie that stirs up masculine urges to conquer, and fight for what's right.",gladiator
"I really didnt had hope on this movie, I didn’t know why it was said to be good, so I watched it just to give my opinion, GOD, this movie may be boring on the first 10 minutes but besides that the movie is entertaining on a way that you can’t pause it and just only see it to the end, a incredibly actuation and gory scenes that makes this movie feel like Rome, I recommend this movie a lot, easily enters my top 10 favorite movies.",gladiator
"Pure grit and glory. Russell Crowe brings so much power to the role, and the story of revenge and honor never gets old. One of the most badass historical epics out there.",gladiator
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The story is compelling and it was thrilling from start to finish. I definitely recommend it for medieval and action fans!,gladiator
"This is a must watch. You can't help but feel inspired seeing a man (Maximus) of sheer will and determination overcome adversity to do what he needed to do. The fight scenes are life or death and you'll constantly be on edge hoping that our hero won't get slashed or stabbed by all the swords and spears swinging around. Russell Crowe did a phenomenal job conveying the heartbreak, anger, and courage of Maximus as it's impossible to not cheer for the guy after all that he went through. Joaquin Phoenix also did an amazing job with Commodus. I've never had seen a villain that boiled my blood so much and I was so happy when fell. The ending is bittersweet and a perfect ending to a movie. At the end of the day, it's not about whether we come out alive or not but if we find our peace at the end knowing that we did everything that we could to do. Because when death smiles at us all, all a man can do is smile back. ∞🤞",gladiator
"While not exactly true to history but some fantastic acting, action, emotion, revenge and death. An epic masterpiece for it's time that still holds up in 2025.",gladiator
"Director Ridley Scott steps up his game here with ""Gladiator,"" with an excellent plot, character development, directing, cast, set design, etc. Scott's direction and storytelling allows the audience to yearn for more and wonder what is going to happen next as they watch each scene.",gladiator
"My number 3 movie for me and the only movie I went to the cinema two times. Joaquin Phoenix pffff, what a actor, but still I find Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington a little bit better. Russel Crowe also very good and Connie Nielsen amazing (very beautiful woman).",gladiator
Courage! People that were able to watch it in theaters! Love those movies. I still watch it. The older the movie is the harder movies are for the younger generations to get behind. If they enhanced and made 4D it would make a huge difference!,gladiator
"My review is about 25 years late, but Gladiator is a film that never moved me to see it, didn’t move me when I finally saw it, and didn’t move me when watching it for this review. What Gladiator is is an epic spectacle that is the perfect example of what a quality film should look like; a film made for awards, critics, fictitious Roman history buffs, and fans of gladiator movies.",gladiator
"An instant classic. I've watched it countless times over the years, ever since its release. This film made me fall in love with Hans Zimmer's music and turned me into a fan of Ridley Scott (at least up until A Good Year). I even read different versions of the script, which only deepened my understanding of what made this hard-fought film so great. Pure entertainment.",gladiator
"This FILM echoes in eternity... EPIC - GRITTY - INSPIRING - MAGNIFICENT Gladiator is every man's appropriate response to such loss. I'd wake up a gladiator too if I were Maximus. The sheer scale of this film has me in awe. For 2000? Oh yeah. Production design is on another level... can we please make movies like this again??? The visual effects aren't my favorite though. The color grading for the afterlife sequences is too dull, and between the floating heads and the glitchy slow-motion shots feel cheesy, but it's not enough to derail the film. Apparently the Academy loved it though... None of that pulls from the magnificent performances of the cast, notably Crowe. Just... wow. Seeing this, I understand where he pulls that stoic energy from for some of his other roles (Robin Hood, The Water Diviner, Man of Steel, Master and Commander). It's the story and script that are the muscle of this film (though it seems the Academy disagrees on this point as well...). A man... who has lost everything... wife, son, honor, status... and all so horrifically... tossed to the gladiators of Rome to be slaughtered for sport... and we are on the very EDGE of our seats to see... what does he do next? Will he give up? Will he give in to the overwhelming grief that even we can seem to taste... or will he rise up, in the face of every adversity... and fight the very emperor himself to regain his lost honor and restore justice to a corrupt nation? That is the story in every man, even at the simplest level. There is nothing more inspiring than that. The script sets up everything so well to come crashing down, slowly builds up again, sparks hope, then all is lost... creating the perfect conditions to forge a hero. Trust me. You'll understand when you see it. While being heavily masculine, it doesn't lose a single drop of emotion. It's a rollercoaster. Great lines bring some enthusiastic ""oh yeah!!!""-moments, while Maximus' loss stabs your heart strings, and victories throughout leave you cheering. Just for laughs...... I saw many other films before seeing Gladiator... so my initial reaction is through this lens: Dumbledore and Robin Hood try to overthrow the Joker as emperor of the Roman Empire.",gladiator
Finally got round to seeing this and I completely understood the hype. This is just a really engaging movie and this is the best performance I have seen for Russel Crowe and the same can be said for Joaquin Pheonix. The battle scenes were just excellent and the story was really good. I'm very much happy I decided to watch it.,gladiator
"Where do I even start? This film is like a Roman feast—swords, sandals, and Russell Crowe dishing out a main course of ""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!""First off, let’s dive into the action. The fight scenes are so electrifying And those coliseum battles? Absolute perfection. It’s like WWE, but with more lions and fewer folding chairs. “strength and honor” motto is so motivating that I’ve started using it at the gym. The soundtrack? Hans Zimmer, you are a genius. The music is so grand that I now play it while doing boring tasks like folding laundry or microwaving leftovers. Gladiator is the perfect mix of drama, action, and unintentional comedy (looking at you, Commodus).",gladiator
This movie was an instant classic when it came out. The cinematic perspective alone would make this movie a 4 star movie . The plot is engaging and the accuracy of the Roman empire was not disregarded. The acting is strong and the story is entertaining. One of ten really great movies of the era.,gladiator
"Um verdadeiro clássico, mas as atuações do Russel Crowe e do Joaquin Phoenix estão terríveis. Roteiro muito bem elaborado, fico feliz em saber que levou oscar de melhor filme na época.",gladiator
An enjoyable movie that all though it can drag at times it keeps you entertained enough to want to know what’s going to happen next. You find yourself rooting for Maximas to win the battles he’s in.,gladiator
"This was an amazing film. Truely, It was beautifully well told. Even though it might b a little to Rated-r at points, I still loved it. I give it a 94%",gladiator
Film at its best. Every element of movie-magic excellence is represented in full here. Your emotion's are Scott's to hold for every minute - mastery of the medium.,gladiator
"Absolutely fantastic! I still remember seeing it at the cinema when it came out. Totally blown away by the battle scenes, Russell Crowe was fantastic (sex in sandals/sex on a horse/sex in a jail cell) and Joaqin Phoenix was wonderfully creepy and menacing with a super storyline that just picked you up and whisked you away to fantasy land. Utterly engrossing with not one bad step along the way.",gladiator
"One of the greatest movies of all time. Great writing, great direction, great casting, great acting. As close as you're ever going to get to perfection. Absolutely amazing.",gladiator
"Iconically and originally one of Ridley Scott’s best projects other than Alien, Hannibal, and etc. I would definitely own this film on 4K Ultra HD 👌👍",gladiator
"I laughed during the entire movie it was so ridiculous. Best laugh was upon seeing the sharks in the flooded coliseum, all I could hear was Dr. Evil. ""I said I wanted fricken sharks with fricken laser beams on their heads!!!!""",gladiator
"Gladiator is a timeless classic that combines historical drama with intense action, creating an unforgettable cinematic experience and is only strengthened by an absolutely stunning score.",gladiator
"Watching this groundbreaking movie was amazing. It was spoken of at the water coolers in work places across the country even after the audience had left the theaters behind. Maximus is almost a household name. The characters are memorable and even after a few decades I can recall its scenes easily. “Strength and honor” “What we do in life echos into the next” “At my signal, unleash hell”",gladiator
"I never saw it on release but it has aged very poorly and seems more like a parody now. Terrible dialogue, cheesy performances and lead characters that are more like caricatures of historical figures, so they can't draw any emotion to make you care for their plight. Top it off with a b-grade soundtrack that has no subtlety and plays like a carnival attraction. This surely is among the most overrated movies in recent history and I can't find anything to like about it.",gladiator
I remember watching this in the cinema at 17 years of age and walking out after it saying that it was the greatest movie I had ever seen. The music. The action. The plot. The acting. The sacrifice. The sence of loss and love and unstoppable vengeance.... Nothing has changed in 24 years. Must see movie..... THE TIME FOR HONOURING YOURSELF WILL SOON BE AT AN END.... HIGHNESS..... goose pimples.,gladiator
"what a masterpiece !! russell crowe in his prime what a legend , everything was spot on , story , characters , fight scenes , MUSIC , PLOT . oh i miss the old days Movies . 10/10 Period",gladiator
Great movie and dialogy. Music also suits the scenes. Russell Crowe acting is great. Only problem with The movie is some historical inaccuraties and Joaquin Phoenix acting,gladiator
"A satisfying Roman revenge story told with a modern Hollywood lens (if annoyingly through the timely shakey-cam style that makes some parts hard to watch), Gladiator remains one of Ridley Scott's best, and most epic, films.",gladiator
I realized this was a phenomenal movie when I first saw it. But I did not realize just how phenomenal until I saw Gladiator 2.,gladiator
"A freaking masterpiece. Imagine entering the literal new millennium with a movie that takes place about 1800 years ago, and then it ends up being peak cinema. The opening sequence is a cacophony of movie making. The cinematography, the sound, the action, the fighting. It really injects you with adrenaline and testosterone. Ridley Scott really knows how to tell a story through the art of the action sequence whether it be through the extraterrestrial or through the eyes of pure testosterone. Russell Crow deservedly won the most prestigious awards for being Maximus. Honestly, his line of “ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED” should be preserved for future study along with the best one liners in spoken recorded history. I love this film for everything it is. Compelling doesn’t begin to explain the raw power that secretes from this film.",gladiator
This movie is old still feels my new. the sets used in this movie were super realistic. I loved this movie is i am also a aoe2 fanboy,gladiator
"Far too many movies these days lean into action and violence as their attraction. While this film has its share of violence, it feels reflective of the time and includes the necessary amount. The entire cast is wonderful but Crowe and Phoenix could not have been a better fit for these roles. The story is very human and brutal at the same time. Power, betrayal, perseverance and love are woven together to create a an epic film that is difficult to beat. One of my favorites of all time.",gladiator
"I think this is my favorite movie of all time. Even 20+ years after it was released, it's still epic. I remember going to see it 3x when it came out. I'd guess I've seen this film 40 or 50+ times.",gladiator
"I am surprised I didn’t review this movie on here but, this is one of my all time favorite movies. The action, the writing, the cinematography everything about this movie is like literally perfection to me. Like you had a all star cast just play out one of the best revenge stories ever, I could not recommend this movie enough.",gladiator
"Yes, we are entertained. Is this the greatest film ever? It’s definitely up there. Russell Crowe is almost unassuming, yet has the presence that few actors can dream of. The scene where he single handedly takes out the gladiators in the arena is up there with the all time great movie scenes.",gladiator
Gladiator review I love all the fight scenes and action scenes and how bloody it is that it I don’t care for story I am ready for sequel 4 star 8 out 10 star 80 out 100 star,gladiator
"It is pure genius. The acting performance in this film are amazing, Phoenix especially, so. The fight scenes are well choreographed the plot is interesting and is and emotional and dramatic movie that will have you entertained to the end.",gladiator
"Filme legal, o roteiro é bacana, as cenas de ação são bacanas, a história contada é legal, mas acho que o filme torna um pouco chato por ser muito longo, gostei da batalha final entre Russell crowe vs joaquin phoenix no estádio coliseum, com Russell crowe vencendo.",gladiator
"Oh, how quick they can turn on you... Rewatched after a decade in preparation for the sequel. This movie is phenomenal. The story, the scenes, the excitement, the thrill. Overall, a great experience.",gladiator
"Would recommend. I've always loved the Roman period and it was nice to see it this way, accurate or not. I would also recommend seeing Gladiator II. It is a good sequel.",gladiator
"Being old enough to remember both Ben-Hur and Spartacus, I found this despite spectacle and CGI to be derivitive and lacking in anything beyond that",gladiator
"Possibly one of the best opening scenes of all time. This is a tested and true classic film. Crowe does an excellent job bringing us on his journey, highly recommended.",gladiator
"Gladiator is a stirring historical epic with a suitably muscular hero in Russell Crowe. Add its bloody, well-choregraphed, fight scenes and eminently repeatable one-liners, why would you not be entertained?",gladiator
"After seeing ""Gladiator 2"", I had a new appreciation for all the things ""Gladiator"" did right. Great character development, a villain you love to hate, a strong noble reluctant hero, Shakespearean double-crosses...all this, so when you got to the big action set pieces, you actually rooted for Maximus. Great score, great production, stirring and rousing emotional impact",gladiator
"This is one of my favorite movies, mostly because of Hans Zimmer's incredible score. It's certainly entertaining, giving us lots of epic battles and amazing performances.",gladiator
"One of my all time favorite movies, it catches Russell Crowe at the peak of his acting career. He was in ""The Zone"" for an actor- that period of a talented actor's career where he or she is the ideal age, considered an excellent up and coming actor, and usually has a breakout movie that puts them on the map and creates a buzz about them. Perhaps most important, they start receiving top quality movie scripts. Crowe did Gladiator, The Insider, and A Beautiful Mind, one after another, receiving Academy Award nominations for all three movies, winning two.",gladiator
"A classic revenge story, great characters and a perfect ending. Russel Crowe plays the role of Maximus perfectly and connects with the audience very well. Joaquin Phoenix as commodus was the best choice possible and he gives a great emotional performance. Great music by Zimmer and enthralling fight scenes tie together a masterpiece.",gladiator
Theatrics win over historical story plausibility and pure common sense. The story is overly simplified. Hans Zimmer's music and Russell Crow's performance are great but they cannot make up for these shortcomings.,gladiator
"Truly an epic film that continues to stand the test of time , watched 5th time this past summer (when 4th time was 8 years ago) , really enjoy it every time, screen play and filmography are of the highest quality, acting by most of cast is on point and very engaging .. a must watch for all generations",gladiator
Absolutely mesmerising movie until today. Excellent acting by Russell Crowe and entire cast & Joaquin Phoenix was phenomenal. Story was great but could have had a better ending for a Sequel.,gladiator
"First of all, you're reading this review from someone who has just seen this for the first time before seeing the sequel. I was ten when this came out and could never see this due to being raised differently. But seeing this for the first time, I do see why folks consider this a masterpiece. However, this isn't as much of a masterpiece to me. I was entertained, though. So the story is a bit simple from a revenge story to overthrowing a usurper who murdered his own father. I do get behind with it as it was built okay. Just wish the beginning needed a little more time to develop. Though it would make the movie a little longer, but that might be me. In the second and last third is where it gets better between the interactions with the characters, the action in the colosseum and the ending, which I will keep that a secret. The best that I could give out of this are the music score with both Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, the setting of the movie along with their costumes and the action like I'm watching an actual gladiator fight. Sure, I will admit, this is like a dad film, but still worth it to see the actors play it out. In my personal opinion, I didn't think too much of the Commodus, played by Joaquin Pheonix, being that much of a threat until the third act when he gets better until he gets his just desserts at the end. Granted, he is played as a corrupted politician, yet I can believe him being similar to the usual ""big, bad, businessman"" troupe that I was never too fond of in movies. Fortunately, he does get better by the third act of the film. Everyone else does great from Russel Crowe as the main lead to work his way back up to the ranks to entertain the crowd along with his interactions through his life as a slave to gladiator. Connie Nielson, Oliver Reed and Djimon Hounsou were also great in their roles when interacting with Maximus as the story goes. The other characters did well in their given roles, too. Simple, yes, but was still entertained as a whole when seeing this film for the first time. Even to see Ridley Scott's work in his prime. For this, I give this eight Russel Crowe yelling to the crowd, ""Are you not entertained,"" out of ten. 8/10.",gladiator
"Gladiator is one of my all-time favorite movies! I absolutely loved the intense action scenes and the epic battles—they were so well done and kept me hooked the entire time. Russell Crowe was incredible as Maximus; his performance was powerful and full of emotion. The story of honor, revenge, and redemption was gripping, and I found myself completely invested in his journey. Plus, Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack added so much to the overall experience. It’s a movie I can watch over and over and still be blown away every time!",gladiator
"This film provided a deeply nostalgic experience, bringing me back to my childhood when I first watched the original and was captivated by it. Now, as an adult, watching this sequel, it’s incredible to see the evolution of the story, the characters, and the production values. The storyline effectively blends historical elements with modern sensibilities, and as someone with a strong appreciation for history, I found it particularly engaging. It’s a stark reminder of how much the world and our technology have evolved. While the original film, released in 2000, still holds up visually, this latest installment takes things to another level in terms of beauty and innovation. It’s truly remarkable to witness. The performances across the board were outstanding. From Denzel Washington to Pedro Pascal, each actor fully embraced their role, creating a sense of authenticity and depth. However, Paul Mescal deserves special recognition. His performance was exceptional, demonstrating impressive range and emotional depth that significantly elevated the film. Every actor brought something unique to their role, contributing to a compelling and immersive experience. The cinematography was also a standout. The shots, camera angles, and color gradients were all meticulously crafted to enhance the story visually. The director clearly had a strong vision for the film, and it was executed brilliantly. As someone with a background in film studies, I greatly appreciated the attention to detail in every frame. What I particularly appreciated about this sequel is how it provided closure for fans of the original film. In an era where many sequels feel like cash grabs, this one felt like a true continuation of the story, with genuine care and respect for the source material. It was a refreshing change, and the filmmakers succeeded in preserving what made the first film special while expanding the narrative in a satisfying way. The pacing was another strength. At no point did I find myself disengaged or bored; the film maintained a steady rhythm that kept me invested from beginning to end. Overall, I would rate this film a solid 10/10. I have no complaints and am extremely satisfied with the final product. It’s a rare sequel that truly honors its predecessor while delivering something new and exciting.",gladiator
"From the timeline of introducing the plot of the movie to the eclipse of the conclusion of the movie, this is truly a masterpiece. If you love action mixed with suspense, drama and a yearn for emotion, this is your movie to watch.",gladiator
What a disappointment. Convoluted uninspired boring story. I actually left before the climax. Denzel is the only working actor. The rest uninterested yawns. Terrible direction.,gladiator
"Russell Crowe delivers a career-defining performance, bringing intensity and humanity to Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally compelling as the unstable and power-hungry Commodus, offering a chilling portrayal of vulnerability and malice. Gladiator combines outstanding performances, stunning visuals, and a powerful narrative to deliver an unforgettable cinematic experience. Whether for its iconic lines, emotional depth, or thrilling action, the film remains a must watch for audiences. Don't even get me started on the music...",gladiator
There was not one single authentically original thought in this film. The story is weak. The characters one dimensional. I could have cared less what happened to the gladiator himself since the film’s set up of him was non existent. I knew this was a disaster when 650 people in the IMax theatre laughed simultaneously when the maid peaked around the column to spy on what was supposed to be an intense moment of political treason. The movie was fake from the first frame to the last.,gladiator
"The original film ""Gladiator,"" featuring Russell Crowe, is an exhilarating ride full of entertainment and suspense. It immerses viewers in a journey reminiscent of Greek mythology, where fierce battles unfold in the grand arena. The film begins in a chaotic war setting, leaving audiences disoriented as they try to grasp the direction of the story. However, it soon settles into a gripping tale of conflict, chaos, and combat. The action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, showcasing exceptional craftsmanship throughout the film. The character development is compelling, allowing viewers to connect with the protagonists and understand their motivations and the path they are on. The overall experience is remarkable, and I strongly recommend watching this film before diving into its sequel. While I generally don't gravitate towards this genre, I found ""Gladiator"" to be a worthwhile one-time experience. Its length is a bit daunting for me to consider a repeat viewing, but the storytelling and concept are commendable. One aspect that strikes me as peculiar is seeing Russell Crowe as the leading character in ""Gladiator,"" especially when he portrays Zeus in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His physique seems mismatched for the role of a god in that universe. It's not about body shaming; it's simply that casting choices should align with character expectations. It’s puzzling to witness Crowe, who fits the mold of a divine figure in ""Gladiator,"" not meet the same standards in the MCU. Age shouldn't be an excuse in Hollywood, where the industry often overlooks it.",gladiator
"Its a great revenge story, with some of the best dialogue I've seen in any film, I'm shocked to not see it rated higher. For me it's a must watch!!",gladiator
"The acting, the story, the scenes, amazing! The soundtrack suits perfect with every scene. It's a master piece. Gladiator I, should have been a single movie, no one asked for a part II.",gladiator
"Start to finish this is a perfect movie. This deserved every Oscar back in 2001. How did Ridley Scott not get best director in 2001. I haven't seen this in a long time and it was fantastic experiencing it once again . Holy crap Joaquin Phoenix was creepy to his sister. Hands down Russell Crowe best performance. They don't make movies like this . Great story, great costumes, Hans Zimmer score is awesome. 10/10 EPIC FANTASTIC movie.",gladiator
This should have 100% on rotten tomatoes. This is top 3 best movie ever made. This was Joaquin Phoenix best roll ever. All the supporting actors were amazing. The storyline was outstanding.,gladiator
"The acting was okay, the action scenes meh, and the story was really tortured. Not enough character development for us to care about the hero. The story was so forced it felt like it was written to clone the best scenes from the original and shove in a different sock puppet for the sequel. The best description would be ""lacking."" The film is missing the magic of a good tail, good dialogue, and too short.",gladiator
"Russell Crowe in his prime. The opening scene is legendary. Joaquin Phoenix is as creepy as they come. I am Maximus Decimus Meridius Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions… and I will have my revenge…",gladiator
"""Gladiator"": The Glory and Elegy of a Hero The film ""Gladiator"" is unforgettable for its grand narrative and profound connotations. At the beginning of the film, the magnificence of the Roman Empire stands in sharp contrast to the cruelty of the gladiatorial arena. Maximus, originally a renowned general with numerous military exploits, was reduced to a gladiator due to a court conspiracy. In the gladiatorial arena, he demonstrated unparalleled courage and combat wisdom, and each battle was thrilling. The scenes of the yellow sand filling the air and the earth-shattering shouts made the audience feel as if they were right there. Russell Crowe vividly portrayed Maximus' firmness, pain, and longing for his family. In the face of hardships, he remained unyielding, and his determined eyes conveyed his persistent pursuit of justice and freedom. Meanwhile, the madness and cruelty of the villain Commodus were also depicted incisively and vividly, forming a sharp contrast with Maximus. The theme of the film is profound. It not only sings the praises of heroism but also reflects on power, desire, and human nature. The gladiatorial arena is a stage of life and death as well as a place where human nature is laid bare. Maximus finally won glory in the gladiatorial arena and avenged his family. His legend has become a brilliant yet tragic chapter in the long history of Rome, leaving the audience immersed in that world full of passion and legend long after watching the film, feeling the glory and sorrow of the hero. I usually use these two sites for more free movies and short dramas.If you have a better website, please recommend it to me. Thank you  ",gladiator
"The contradictions and conflicts between Maximus and Commodus are important clues that drive the development of the plot. Commodus' jealousy, ambition, and madness make him a highly charismatic villain. He is eager to obtain his father's recognition, but due to his own character flaws, he has embarked on a path of no return. Meanwhile, Maximus' longing for his family and his obsession with revenge enable him to maintain a firm belief in difficult situations. The friendship he has established with other gladiators, such as the mutual admiration with Juba, also adds a touch of warmth to this bloody and violent movie. The incorporation of these emotional elements allows the audience to gain a deeper understanding of the inner worlds of the characters, thus generating a strong emotional resonance. I usually use these two sites for more free movies and short dramas.If you have a better website, please recommend it to me. Thank you  ",gladiator
"Not bad film, definetly not great, denzel was given a bigger part that wouldve been better if cut short, Pedro Pascals character eats the film, Mescal did a good job, the film entertains, but not oscar worthy, kinda an unnecesary sequel.",gladiator
"The film does exactly what it sets out to do, which is to be entertaining. What more can you ask for? Are you not entertained?",gladiator
Gladiator is a film that I can watch multiple times and it still holds up everytime. This was the film that really cemented Russell Crowe as a big time movie star. Here he really shines with his acting chops and charisma. All performances from the cast and production are top notch. This is Ridley Scott at his highest peak with filmmaking. The drama and battle scenes are hard hitting. Every scene carries so much weight and so much at stake. Even if you're not a fan of this genre of film you will probably be hooked by the storyline of lust for power and revenge. Gladiator is one of those rare perfect epics. Gladiator gets a perfect 5 stars out of 5. This film also goes into my top 10 favorite movies of all time.,gladiator
"Other than the fight scenes, the movie was overly narrated as if the audience were toddlers. Combine that with subpar acting and a ridiculous script and you have all the makings of a truly terrible movie.",gladiator
"The acting was dry, across the board. The storyline was weak and rushed. There were so many holes that 20 years should’ve had answers for. The action was of lesser quality than the first. The flashbacks and lines from the first movie to remind you that this movie is tied to a great movie of the past was cringy; the quality of the film should’ve shown that. This movie needed to be longer and less rushed. As a stand alone film, Netflix has some better options. Centurion is a great option.",gladiator
"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen, it has the music, drama, action, sadness, greatness. It has an incredible story that grabs you and carries you through out the movie, with a sublime ending. A must watch movie",gladiator

"One of the all time greatest films, this movie delivers on everything from acting, to incredible quotes, to the amazing story that's delivered by Ridley Scott. Would highly recommend to anyone that can sit through any film as this is truly a film that everyone can enjoy. ""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!""",gladiator
"Even over 20 years later, Gladiator remains a masterpiece that stands the test of time. Russell Crowe delivers a career-defining performance, embodying the strength and honor of Maximus, but the entire cast is exceptional, elevating the film to legendary status. It takes the mantle from Spartacus as the definitive epic, with each scene beautifully shot and filled with emotional depth. At 2.5 hours, the film feels perfectly paced, and honestly, it could have been twice as long without losing any of its impact. Gladiator is a timeless epic that continues to captivate with every rewatch.",gladiator
"This was a fantastic movie for its time. It had a great story and acting, with Russell Crowe being a stand out. The action was jam packed, and I loved the scenes in the colosseum. Overall, a great movie.",gladiator
"Ridley Scott does it again! This movie really shows how epic ancient Rome could be on the big screen. For a movie that came out in 2000, it still holds up to this day. Russell Crowe is phenomenal as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus is an excellent antagonist.",gladiator
"I wasn’t too excited to watch this film, but to be honest I actually quite enjoyed it. Tomorrow I’m seeing the second film because my grandfather wants to see it, so I thought I should might as well watch the first one. Even though I enjoyed it I don’t understand why they made a second one, this doesn’t really feel like a type of movie that needs a sequel. Anyway overall I think the movie was great, and even though I think making a sequel for this movie is pointless I’m still intrigued nonetheless!",gladiator
I was entertained is really beautifully epic and the cast are marvelous and Hans Zimmer score is really beautiful powerful and both emotional and entertained.,gladiator
"""Gladiator"" unleashes a thrilling protagonist you will love and an antagonist you will dread. Although some of the visuals might feel outdated, Ridley Scott once again demonstrates how to craft a well-paced movie.",gladiator
"“Gladiator” delivers entertainment and spectacles that are as raw and visually engaging as an actual gladiator match. When it comes to storytelling, its originality was buried beneath the sands by its formulaic and bloated narrative and grim tone. However, the film is another example of utilizing its style, visual grandeur, and emotional core to elevate most of the narrative shortcomings. As mentioned earlier, Ridley Scott is seen as a visual storyteller attempting to balance the seemingly straightforward plots with the splendor of the cinematic scales, gloomy atmospheres, action set pieces, and character-driven drama. While most of his films aren’t as great as others, Scott has repeatedly proven that his presentation shines the most in balancing blockbuster aesthetics with an authentic and down-to-earth atmosphere, with “Gladiator” being one of those examples. With its stellar cast, compelling direction, suitable screenplay, and outstanding technical aspects, the movie has enough bloodshed and appeal to entertain plenty of fans of Scott’s works.",gladiator
"Greatest movie of all time, epic storytelling, amazing cinematography, powerful acting, some of the best action scenes. Some of the most iconic quotes, this movie has stood the test of time and will forever be a classic.",gladiator
"Para empezar con el nuevo milenio, Ridley Scott presento una de sus mejores películas después de Alien y una estupenda historia épica de honor y venganza. Gladiator es una película épica del cine moderno que hasta a la altura de muchos clásicos del cine épico. Russell Crowe ofrece lo mejor de su carrera cinematográfica como Maximus en su búsqueda por vengar la muerte de su familia y la del honorable Marcus Aurelius tras ser traicionado por su propio hijo Commodus. Es una de esas historias donde el imperio romano tenía a un gobernador que consiguió poder por medio de la traición y la muerte de sus seres más confiables. Commodus ansiaba ser el nuevo Cesar después de que su padre falleciera y estaba dispuesto a conservar ese poder aun si debía eliminar a sus obstáculos. Maximus era la persona ideal para liderar roma, pero termino siendo traicionado por Commodus y eso desata todo el argumento de la película. Vemos como Maximus pasa de ser un esclavo a un admirable gladiador y así obtener la oportunidad de encontrarse nuevamente con Commodus y liberar a Roma de un emperador tirano. Es una historia que está muy bien relatada y la buena producción hace de esta película una agradable experiencia. Las escenas de combate, la banda sonora de Hans Zimmer y el vestuario son dignos de este tipo de películas. Ridley Scott logró hacer una película que le hace honor al cine épico y eso hace que Gladiator sea otra de las mejores películas que se hayan hecho. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10.",gladiator
"Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott, is an epic journey into ancient Rome, with breathtaking visuals, a compelling story, and powerful performances that have cemented this film as one of the greats in cinematic history.",gladiator
"For the glory of the audience Ridley Scott crafted an absolutely epic movie. The set design and costume design is absolutely stunning. The Cinematography is amazing especially for the movie being nearly 25 years old. This movie looks absolutely beautiful and some of the shots are breathtaking. The performances are all excellent with standouts from Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe. It was brutal violent, and gory. The movie was extremely well written with amazing dialogue, and was also well shot and directed. In the grand scheme of things, Ridley Scott truly created an epic spectacle.",gladiator
"What we do in life echoes in eternity. Gladiator is a 2000 historical epic film directed by Ridley Scott 🍿 Awesome in every way 😀 An absolute must see! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 One of my all time favourite movies ⭐️ In the year 180, the death of Emperor Marcus Aurelius throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals, as well as a key advisor to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus ascends to the throne, Maximus is sentenced to execution. He escapes but is captured by slave traders. Renamed ""Spaniard"" and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death against other men for the amusement of paying audiences.",gladiator
"It will go down in history as a certified classic. Maximus is not the only protagonist, there is a rich pool of other protagonists, all visually undergoing a journey of character growth and forming deep emotional bonds on screen. He captures the heartbreak of Maximus losing everything he holds dear exquisitely, and the pace and nature of his rising from the ashes to greatness once again is equally exquisite. The dialogue is careful and articulated (not too word heavy) and the magic is in how the characters carry themselves in body language, deeds, and manner. P.S it's a shame gladiator two is such an unbelievably disappointing contrast to these qualities that made the original one of the greats",gladiator
Have loved this film from moment one back in 2000 when I first saw it on the cinema. Watched it again in readiness to see Gladiator 2 tomorrow afternoon (17 Nov 2024). Once again I was entertained.,gladiator
"Gladiator (2000) is a masterpiece. Its violence, its bloody fights, its photography and real environments that resemble Ancient Rome are the soul of this film. Rating 7.5",gladiator
Watched it in preparation for the second movie and I was really blown away by the amazing story line and especially the film set. To achieve this much detail and good quality almost 25 years ago is truly amazing,gladiator
Pretty great movie. Maximus needs a shorter catchphrase though. Joaquin Phoenix finally plays a character that’s so similar to him he won’t even be acting. It’s great to see Maximus return as a schizophrenic just like he is in a beautiful mind and Noah.,gladiator
"Still one of my favourite films of all time. Raw action that means something pitted against injustices and the insatiable desire for vengeance against all odds. Crowe and Phoenix at their absolute best. In fact all cast delivers, music score it rousing. Cannot fault it. Still delivers to this day.",gladiator
"Gladiator is a classic in every sense of the word, blending historical drama with intense, unforgettable action sequences that still hold up today. Its emotional beats are as powerful as its battle scenes, creating a story that’s both thrilling and deeply moving. Russell Crowe delivers a career-defining performance as Maximus, perfectly matched by Joaquin Phoenix’s chilling portrayal of Commodus. The ensemble cast shines in this epic tale, set against stunning Roman landscapes and enhanced by one of the greatest soundtracks of all time.",gladiator
"One of the greatest films ever made, Gladiator is a historical epic with the plot of a crime saga, complete with captivating performances, stunning cinematography, a gorgeous score and breathtaking production design.",gladiator
One of the best action movie I have ever seen with some of my favorite fictional characters I’ve ever seen. Commodus and Maximus are what make the movie great 10/10,gladiator
"""Gladiator"" is an absolute classic that still holds up incredibly well after all these years. The cast is fantastic, with Russell Crowe delivering a memorable performance as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix playing a villain you genuinely love to hate. The quotes are iconic, the worldbuilding is top-notch, and the action scenes are intense, brutal, and feel very real. The cinematography and Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack really add to the epic feeling—it’s both heartbreaking and incredibly badass. Watching this as a lead-up to the ""Gladiator 2"" screening tomorrow, I was completely entertained and the time just flew by. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over and still get chills. A timeless, strong film that makes you cheer for the hero and despise the villain to the core.",gladiator
"It remains enormously entertaining if also very silly in some ways. It's paced enormously well so you thankfully don't feel the runtime (unlike a lot of sword and sandal epics) and while I don't really think it deserved ""Best Picture"" its nice to remember a time when Dad movies could win.",gladiator
"Even for the most earnest movie buff, there are only a handful of spots in your pathos box for truly magical theatrical experiences - the movie feels - that trigger a mix of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine to come together in your brain. This was one of them that hit different. Music, always underrated, is huge. Hans Zimmer. Big check. Acting. Maximus won that Best Actor. Young Commodus went on to win one of his own. Supporting actors? THE Sir Richard Harris and his Shakespearean heavyweight Ollie Reed lent huge gravitas at the brilliant sunsets of their fabled careers. And that cinematography - otherworldly and sublime. Mixed perfectly with some lovely CGI wide work. The Am I Not Merciful scene is a breathtaking mix of Ridley Scott forceful direction, Zimmer's stirring score and that hatred and vulnerability, the scarred beauty that only Joaquin Phoenix could produce. On a night when Gladiator took home Best Picture, Russell Crowe delivered for me the most inspirational Best Actor acceptance speech in Oscar history. Vaya con Dios.",gladiator
"Watched Gladiator in 2025 as in 2000 I didn't have time to watch films. Nothing unfolds over the course of two sleep-inducing hours. Staggeringly dull, boring, slow-moving, repetitive, uninspiring and wildly overrated.",gladiator
"Amazing performances and production design, plus this was probably the fastest 150 minutes of my life, it felt like just 90 minutes, and that's a very rare testment most movies can only dream of making; though the direction by Scott is very hit or miss, like, one of the most extreme examples of 50/50 i have ever seen, all the action scenes are either spectacular and eye-catching or the most confusing and somehow boring thing you will ever see; plus the story is nothing new and quite generic.",gladiator
"One of the greatest films of all-time. I’m telling you I’ve seen this film about a million times and I’ll watch it a million more. The acting, the story, THE MUSIC! Oh my gosh everything is perfect. Some of the best dialogue ever spoken in cinema history. This film could easily be considered as the one of the greatest of all-time by a majority.",gladiator
Never have I ever been so bored watching a movie. The performances were awful and this is by far one of the worst to win best picture at the Oscars. Tim Treakle,gladiator
One of the best films I have ever seen. The only reason it is not 5 stars is because of the dialog which in some scenes is really corny. This is quite possibly Russell Crowe's best film.,gladiator
"I found Gladiator to be an excellent period action war movie, which I typically enjoy, especially when centered on Roman culture. The story introduces us to Maximus, a great man with simple wishes, whose life takes a dramatic turn after being betrayed. This sets off his journey of revenge. While I appreciate the film's politics, pacing, and dialogues, the visuals, particularly of the Colosseum, may be disappointing. However, it's worth considering that the movie was made in the early 2000s. Despite this, I believe most viewers will enjoy the film overall.",gladiator
"Well acted, great direction and a main character that stands out as one of the greatest in movie history. There are few movie experiences better than this one.",gladiator
"I would put Gladiator on the Top 100 Greatest Films of All-Time List and don’t hesitate to add it to my own personal Top 10 List. It is less of a revenge story, as some suggest, and is more of a graphic saga about why words like justice, strength, and honor ought to prevail over greed, envy, and corruption. From a technical standpoint, I don’t think there is a single poorly casted actor, stunt, costume, score piece, set, or scripting that falters throughout the film, with one of the most quotable lines in cinematic history, “Are you not entertained?!” If there are historical inaccuracies, so be it. Crowe’s performance is second to none portraying an honorable soldier and a humble, non-greedy husband who must overcome a coup attempt of murder on his life after he just won a last war for Rome, and then the incredibly tragic scene of betrayal towards his beloved family and home. Apart from Heath Ledger’s Joker performance and Gollum in the Lord of the Ring’s, I often put Phoenix’s portrayal of Commodus as the third best villain of all time in cinematic history, and have struggled to see him as anything else ever since his role in the movie. There are many parallels throughout the film that can be applied to modern life and politics making it a relevant film adding social commentary on current affairs. After visiting Rome, the Colosseum was one of the first sites I visited along with the Pantheon. The Colosseum didn’t appear quite as large as the film makes it out to be.",gladiator
"""Gladiator"" is an extraordinary film that transcends the boundaries of epic storytelling and cinematic artistry. Directed by Ridley Scott, this masterpiece takes viewers on a gripping journey through ancient Rome, weaving a tale of revenge, honor, and redemption that leaves an indelible mark on the heart and mind. Russell Crowe delivers a powerful performance as Maximus Decimus Meridius, a once-noble general turned slave who seeks vengeance against the corrupt emperor, Commodus, played brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe's portrayal is both fierce and vulnerable, capturing the essence of a man stripped of everything yet fueled by an unyielding desire for justice. The dynamic between Maximus and Commodus is electric, showcasing the stark contrast between integrity and moral decay. The cinematography is breathtaking, with sweeping landscapes and meticulously crafted battle scenes that immerse the audience in the grandeur of the Roman Empire. The film's visual richness is complemented by Hans Zimmer's haunting score, which elevates every moment, enhancing the emotional depth and intensity of the narrative. Scott’s direction is masterful, balancing epic scale with intimate character moments, making each victory and loss resonate deeply. The screenplay is tight and impactful, filled with memorable quotes and poignant themes that explore the complexities of power, loyalty, and the human spirit. ""Gladiator"" is more than just a historical epic; it’s a timeless tale that explores the struggles of the individual against tyranny and the quest for personal redemption. It’s a film that inspires and captivates, leaving viewers both exhilarated and reflective. In summary, ""Gladiator"" is a flawless blend of compelling storytelling, stellar performances, and breathtaking visuals. It is, without a doubt, a must-see cinematic experience that solidifies its place as one of the greatest films of all time.",gladiator
"At times, the pacing is massively slow, but with highly enjoyable humor, action sequences, visual effects, and terrific performances, this Roman masterpiece is quite possibly one of the best films ever created in cinema history.",gladiator
"It’s a great film , it brings you into its world and you enjoy it more as it goes on. Great acting . I hope the new one doesn’t take from its legacy",gladiator
🍅 7.4/10 This is a total dad movie. This has some pretty thrilling fights and awesome set pieces with people you love and people you hate. didn’t like this as much as I wanted to but that’s fine it’s still a really good movie with a lot of great performances and easy to follow story that makes it enough of a crowd pleaser with classic status. Grade B+,gladiator
"by far the best movie ever, great action, great acting, and unlimited rewatchability, if i could only ever watch one movie this would be it.",gladiator
"Has it all, visuals, sfx, action. What a movie needs overall is a likeable protagonist, one we really root for and Gladiator has it. if you ever were in awe of the Roman Gladiator races and want to feel what it's like to be there, see this movie. It's not only a great action film, but a great drama. You can't go wrong with Crowe and Ridley Scott. Everything I've seen with these two I loved. These types of greats make Hollywood. This movie is bloody though, if you have a queasy stomach, probably not the best to watch, but if you don't and love things that are high octane, I couldn't recommend this more.",gladiator
"Complete masterpiece on all levels...it doesn't get better than this as far as sword medieval movies.Beautiful score,top notch acting from a amazing cast,great script, beautifully filmed Can't say enough good about this movie.",gladiator
"Crowe is really heroic and Phoenix is really creepy. Check. The movie looks good, and while there are a few CGI issues, for the time, it does a fantastic job of merging sets, models and CGI akin to Lord of the Rings. The revenge story is moving and satisfying. My only real beef with this is - that isn't what happened. Of all the intrigue of ancient Rome, there HAD to have been a story in there worth telling! But still very entertaining.",gladiator
"Honestly have nothing bad to say about this movie one of the best movies we’re probs ever gonna see considering movies are very bland nowadays. Great acting, Great costumes, Great writing, beautiful visuals Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe deserves all they got from this movie ending gets me every time",gladiator
"""What we do in life echoes in eternity."" Any man would be honored to die the same death Maxiums had. Epic movie. But the best and most inspirational line came at the end of the movie. ""I will see you again, but not yet, not yet."" - Juba",gladiator
"The world needs movies like this again. About strength, honor, and perseverance all qualities devoid of Hollywood and the general public for the last 20 years.",gladiator
"Gladiator manages to blend compelling drama, Shakespearian grandeur and violent action in a near perfect manner because of the masterful direction by Ridley Scott and a great performance by Russel Crowe.",gladiator
One of my top movies which story and production hold up for years. I could list the entire cast for their great acting. Another great job by Ridley Scott.,gladiator
"Regardless of historical inaccuracies, it's a great film. Top 5 Favorite films. If you are into Rome, Lore, History, with a little Flair and Gore, then Buckle up this ones for you!",gladiator
"A film of incomparable heroism and a Greek tragedy. I’ll never look at a wheat field the same way again. I enjoy the soundtrack on Spotify often, alongside Blade Runner and Dune. I love this movie. All the awards were deserved. Crowe made my top 5 actor list after this film. Bravo, from a fellow thespian!",gladiator
"One of Ridley Scott's best movies. The opening battle scene pulls you right in, the plot is fantastic, the pace is fast and the characters are larger than life. Everyone is cast perfectly and you really get bought into the characters. Highly recommended!",gladiator
"A epic movie to be sure, this is not a movie to be missed. Russel Crowe is Gladiator. He completely embodies the role. The rest of the cast fits perfectly into place, especially Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus and Oliver Reed's Proximo. The direction is magnificent. Ridley Scott creates a melody of beautiful shots blended with great performances. The action sequences are quite good, with the battle at the beginning being a particular highlight. You gotta check this movie out, you will be entertained.",gladiator
"One of my all time top films. For me this is the film that defines 'epic'. Fantastic story full of emotion, love it! Also the music score is perfect.",gladiator
"A good movie for 12 yr old boys. It is beautiful and Crowe is good. But this has all been done before. It is made for those who will not watch Spartacus or any of the countless better films it rehashes. The CGI is cheap looking. And how exactly does Maximus (injured) get from territory that is now Germany, across the Alps, across the Pyrenees, and deep into Iberia, before magically being found by the Moors? How does Commodus kill Richard Harris without Harris showing any struggle? The action slows down for self important reflective sounds and music. Including Celtic sounding pretentious theme music. Again, its ok to good, but its a rehash of whats been done much better, and primarily for an adolescent movie mindset.",gladiator
"Gladiator is a historical epic with beautiful set designs along with Han Zimmer's sensational score. The action scenes are great, with Joaquin Phoenix delivering arguably one of his best performances. That said, the film lacked substance, often feeling undernourished which fails to compensate for its long runtime.",gladiator
"An All-Time Great film from an All-Time Great Director, with 2 separate All-Time performances from both Crowe & Phoenix. Not to mention the rest of the cast, the cinematography & score are all stellar. I struggle to find a negative aspect of, or a reason not to watch, this film.",gladiator
"- banda sonora - inicio cesar comodo y maximo un poco meh telenovelesco - show belico, tampoco nada ultra emocionante - buen giro que no escape",gladiator
"The movie in general is great: it's watchable and has at some great plot just i dont know about historical acuracy but one think that lil bit dosent fit is the villan of the movie, it just shows ""OH LOOK AT ME MY AM EVIL AND I WILL DO EVIL STUFF"" and even look like tho and main protagonist looked like compleatly a hero, for others it's great so summiries plot and eazy to folow, but for me it anoyis me, one way or another i really like the movie",gladiator
"Just a classic. Two of the deleted scenes should have made the original film (along with everything else which did make it). It is essentially historical fiction, but has tremendous depth and is just a brilliant film.",gladiator
"One of my all-time favorites. Historical fiction for sure; based around a couple real people. Visually stunning, holds up 22 years later! I love the story, I love the depiction of how a warrior with nothing to lose is hard to distinguish from the ferocity of man with everything to lose. The soul of a true warrior is well depicted here, also the camaraderie of warriors, and how man's heart lives and dies for the beauty he loves.",gladiator
"Gladiator is a ""historical"" epic from director Ridley Scott, which won the best picture Oscar back in 2000. It has an emotional story, fantastic cinematography, and great characters, Maximus of course being the standout. The performances are fantastic as well. Despite many historical inaccuracies, Gladiator is a fantastic revenge film.",gladiator
"From the director of Alien and American Gangster, Gladiator is one of his best films of all time and just like Alien for that matter, this is one of those movies that I really love every time I am entertained. Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return home after he leads the Roman army to victory against the Germanic tribes. Emperor Marcus Aurelius played by Richard Harris, tells him that his brother, Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix, will not rule as emperor and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to restore the Roman Republic. Marcus informs Commodus of his decision; but in response, he murders his father. He proclaims himself as the new emperor and requests loyalty from Maximus, who refuses. Maximus is arrested and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors and is wounded, rides for his home near Turgalium, where he finds his wife and child crucified. Slavers find him and take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to gladiator trainer Proximo. Despite that this is similar to every Moses story, this movie is awesome in every way possible with it's fantastic fight sequences even when Maximus won his first match against other gladiators I said "" Ah ha ha ha! Are you not entertained?"" right before he said ""Are you not entertained? Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?"" Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both fantastic in this playing off against each other. There are plenty of epic movies I've seen during to this day, some of which are both go up to three hours and down to three hours in that category. Gladiator is a fantastic epic historical action drama that builds up for it's immense cinematography, fantastic acting, great directing and good music by Hans Zimmer. If there is one thing I'd like to mention while doing this review is that when you get to see Richard Harris again, you'll get to see him again as Professor Dumbledore in Harry Potter. Hahaha. Yeah. This movie is very good and is the one I will watch over and over every time I'm in the mood to be entertained.",gladiator
"Regardless of the historical inaccuracies, Gladiator is one of the greatest movies of all time. Any man who has respect for history dreams of being Maximus and serving Rome until his last breath.",gladiator
The narrative sometimes stumbles as it edges towards redemption and revenge but the depth Crowe gives his character makes it enjoyable. The battle scenes are also spectacular.,gladiator
"This revenge driven epic is so quotable a whole class could find different ones for their yearbook pages. In other words, the spectacle is paired with fitting powerful lines and performances which makes this Best Picture winner a timeless classic.",gladiator
"""Are you not entertained?"" Gladiator is a phenomenal achievement in cinema. The execution is near-flawless, with excellent storytelling, directing, acting and everything in between. The first act is full of exposition, which can get tiresome. However, once you hit the 45 minute mark, it is full steam ahead. The story of redemption is incredibly captivating and leaves a mark. Maximus is a powerful character and his foil, Commodus, is despicable. To cap it all off, the finale of this film is one of the best in modern film history. I don't think of the Roman Empire often, but when I do, it is because of Gladiator. Best Character: Maximus Best Quote: ""My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius..."" Best Scene: Elysium Best Piece of Score: ""Now We Are Free"" Note: I love Hans Zimmer, but the Pirates of the Caribbean score is a little too close to this.",gladiator
"I believe that the film ""Gladiator"" is a true masterpiece and one of the best works of the legendary Ridley Scott. I highly recommend viewing to everyone who has not yet had time to familiarize themselves with this work.",gladiator
"Amazing! I think I saw this in the movie theaters more than 10 times. Great on screen! They are making a part 2! I would love it but when they update films today, they usually ruin it with the cast and stories.",gladiator
"From story telling, to dialogue and beyond! A masterpiece that keeps you glued to the screen the entire time. Emotional, action packed. You'll be content once finished but at the same time you'll want a gladiator 2!",gladiator
"I can see why people graded this lowly because of historical accuracy… That being said as time goes by, this show would be extremely accurate compared to the movies coming out nowadays lol. Jokes aside I'm a Roman Empire / Greek history enthusiast and went out of my way to learn more about each civilization in my college years. The names and actions are extremely mixed up in this movie but I still believe this movie is not only great but visually educates people on what the Roman Empire was. ON TOP of that the story line and plot twist deserve an A+. Russel Crowe is the man!",gladiator
a must see roman setted movie with a young but oh so vibrant action lead Russel Crowe who gives the performance of a life time,gladiator
"What a great movie! I typically don't watch movies of this type, but this was a gem! The emotional ties that keep you glued to your seat are incredible. The main characters are lovable and really make you want to keep watching to root for them!",gladiator
"Man vs man a classic story of revenge set in ancient Rome, bursting with brilliant performances solid action and awesome sets. Sword and sandals at it's best.",gladiator
"Although I don't like this movie as much as other people do, it was still great. Although it felt relatively slow and at some points even boring in the first half, the action, acting, and design were top tier. However, the second half was great, and I think Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe are two of my favorite actors after the movie ended. Definitely worth a watch.",gladiator
"Great film! It twists history a bit, but it's still thought-provoking and transportive to another world. Fantastic acting and visuals, music, everything you could possibly need in an epic film 💙",gladiator
"Joaquin is such a great villain, you just absolutely hate his guts, much like how his character's father did. And the movie has queen giraffes, I mean c'mon. -.5 for Russel Crowe barely trying to appear to be a native Spaniard",gladiator
"Gladiator is an epic and enthralling historical drama that showcases Russell Crowe's mesmerizing performance as Maximus. Ridley Scott's masterful direction brings ancient Rome to life, blending intense action sequences with emotional depth. The film's grand scale, powerful storytelling, and iconic soundtrack make it a true cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences.",gladiator
"A beautiful movie and a VERY raw one too. Russell Crowe's portrayal is good enough to see a great story of revenge, I'd say satisfying too, even more if you're attached on the term ""Finishing what you started"", because he gets everything done and succeeds with his mission gloriously, returning home in a Hans Zimmer's way that is unforgettable. Also, Joaquin Phoenix made sure to portray a character that deserves to die and you're wishing it, that's what also makes this movie a great story of revenge to follow.",gladiator
"Ridley Scott uses Joaquin and Russell to flesh out two deep characters which he then pits together in an awesome and breathtaking series of fights, in which Commodus meets his end in a deserving finale",gladiator
"Arenada Maximus' un repliği aynen şöyledir: ""my name is maximus decimus meridius, commander of the armies of the north, general of the felix legions, loyal servant to the true emperor , marcus aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and i will take my vengeance in this life or the next!!!""",gladiator
"Another one of my favorite movies of all time. 2000's Gladiator deserves an epic historical masterpiece directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Russell Crowe plays a general who became a slave, then later became a champion in a gladiatorial combat of Ancient Rome.",gladiator
"cool as movie, dude just wants to go home to his farm. joaquin does good as joffrey type emperor. GOT in ancient Roma. fun fact that i made up: a throwaway version of the battle theme by hans zimmer was used as the main theme for pirates of the caribbean, take that info as you will",gladiator
"Perhaps my favorite movie of all times. Russell Crowe went above and beyond for his role in this film. Action pieces were great and entertaining. The plot as a whole was interesting, the revenge story was a very good route to go. The emotional beats hit very well, the wheat field imagery was perhaps some of the best. The Music is something that I cannot ignore, one of the best and most recognizable soundtracks of all time. It fits every scene very well. Overall an excellent film.",gladiator
"É ainda um filme incrível. Posso ver ainda hoje, depois de tantos años de lançamento e ainda adoro cada parte. Foi um dos melhores filmes históricos que já vi. Esse filme ainda deve inspirar muitos outros.",gladiator
Gladiator is an epic movie far superior to most modern movies in every way it champions honor which is in very short supply in hollywood movies these days.,gladiator
"What a movie! It is definitely in my top... Saying that, it is an absolutely entertaining movie that is constantly packed with action and is pretty enjoyable. The music is by far one of the BEST, if not then THE best soundtrack. The battle scenes are very climactic and are overall pretty fun to watch. The plot is really fun, and the movie is loosely based on real events, and disregarding that and a few tactical errors, it is apparently pretty accurate at representing Rome according to several Roman history professors that have spent decades on the subject. There is a few unnoticeable errors that you can't unsee like certain lighting, gas tanks, and unpainted busts, but besides that the movie was pretty darn good. Plot 9/10 Effects 8.7/10 Characters 10/10 Action 9.1/10 Enjoyment 10/10 Historic Accuracy 9.8/10 Overall 9/10",gladiator
Phoenix and Crowe put on a great performance. You can't help but hate Phoenix's character and root for Crowe. A credit to both of their acting chops.,gladiator
"Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",gladiator
"Gladiator is hands down one of the best, if not the best, movies ever made. It’s a masterpiece packed with outstanding acting, breathtaking visuals, and unparalleled emotional depth. The film flawlessly combines all the elements I love in an epic drama—intense action, a gripping tale of revenge, and heartbreaking tragedy. Russell Crowe delivers a standout performance, rivaling his brilliance in A Beautiful Mind. His portrayal of Maximus is unforgettable. The only other film that comes close to capturing this level of epic storytelling is Spartacus (1960). If you haven’t seen Gladiator yet, I can’t recommend it enough—it’s a must-watch!",gladiator
Most fight scenes were insanely choppy you couldnt even tell what was going on. While the final fight scene between Maximus and Commodus was an improvement it still had choppy moments. Not a fan of the slow motion shots either. I felt the score didnt match most scenes and often took me out of the movie. Some parts slower than others. Overall average acting.,gladiator
"Un chef-d'œuvre en tout point, tant dans l'excellente interprétation de Russel Crowe, Joaquin Phœnix et Connie Nielsen, que dans la trame scénaristique riche en émotion et en conduites de vie. Bien que le film dure plus de 2 h 30, son visionnage n'est pas du tout fastidieux, au contraire. Les scènes dans l'arène sont mythiques dans leur mise en scène, appuyant sur l'inéluctabilité de la mort et la morbidité des spectateurs qui prennent plaisir à assister à un spectacle aussi barbare. La musique de fin, Now we are free, clôt magistralement le film.",gladiator
"How this won Best Picture Oscar is one of life's great mysteries. I was bored senseless for every second. The only good thing to come out of it was the confirmation that Joaquin Phoenix is a complete ham actor, and a bad one at that.",gladiator
"I really loved this one. Watched it on the big screen on my 18th birthday over 20 years ago and will always remember it as one of the greatest swords-and-sandals-epics of all time. Perfect pacing, superb fighting scenes, good cast and captivating story with everything a great movie needs: Action, drama and a bit of fun.",gladiator
"I've watched this movie 5 or 6 times. It is a top 5 movie of all time for me. Fantastic acting, great story and exciting action scenes. Strength and honour!",gladiator
"A testament to fantastic filmmaking. The MCU cries at night, begging it could be as inspirational, as original, as groundbreaking, and as memorable as this film.",gladiator
"One of the best epic movies out there. Ridley Scott made a wonderfull job directing this And Russel Crowe made a fantastic job playing Maximus One of the best movies of the century Cinematography,Direction,Screenplay,Action Sequences the cast does an excellent job what a fucking movie",gladiator
"Mi película favorita hasta la fecha, pese ha que tiene muchos gazapos históricos es sin duda una de las mejores películas de la década. Sin duda, ya no se hacen películas así.",gladiator
"The journey that the character takes in this movie is one of the best in the history of cinema. The end is both sad and happy, as the character achieves his goal to get home, but also pays the price for that, which is too high. Russel Crowe's acting is top notch, you begin seeing his character as a real human rather than a fictional character, the same should be said about Joaquin phoenix, whose villain is incredible. The Cinematography and soundtrack are really beautiful making the movie a joy to watch over and over again. The fighting scenes are well-done and perfectly reflect the brutality of those times of human's history. The story may not be special according to some people and even have some goofy moments. but it is told in such a brilliant way, that for me is one of the best. For me this movie is one of the highest points in cinema history and it deserves to be called a masterpiece!",gladiator
"La regia di Ridley Scott è, come sempre, tecnicamente ottima. Ricostruzione scenografica ai massimi livelli. Lascia a desiderare il contenuto, in quanto la trama è una rivisitazione storica molto più vicina alla fantasia che alla realtà. Buon Cast, con Russell Crowe perno importante, e buona anche la sceneggiatura. Godibile.",gladiator
"Among the most perfect of films. As Marcus Aurelius's evil son, Commodus, comes to power in Rome everything changes. This fictional account of a great soldier and Gladiator who stood up against his evil is at the center of this one. The acting is superior. The Direction and cinematography are masterful. The storytelling by Ridley Scott is one of a kind. See this and see it again.",gladiator
"A lacklustre, predictable, and often laughable script full of plot holes which is woven around a Hollywood caricature of Roman society, muddies the otherwise good camera and acting performances.",gladiator
The gladiator who became a slave then took out the emperor to become the saver of Rome. Joqhan phoniex is good at playing the smiley son of the emperor who he killed. Richard Harris plays the emperor Russel Crowe plays the role as the gladiator and Oliver reed plays a part of the slave owner,gladiator
"Gladiator is a true modern epic, drawing heavily on Spartacus but reshuffling narrative elements for an original story. Russell Crowe is fantastic, one of his best roles ever. The action is gripping and brutal. Hans Zimmer's score evokes feelings of some heavenly afterlife. Considering the historical reality of the brutal politics of ancient Rome, on a rewatch I found the ending a bit too ""Hollywood"", with everything being resolved and a nice bow placed on top. But still, this is meant to be a completely fictional story (although placed in a semi-accurate historical setting, with fictional versions of some historical figures), so I can't get too upset at any inconsistencies with reality. It feels more inspired by mythology and the swords and sandals epics of the 50's & 60's, then it is by any historical commitment.",gladiator
"An excellent Ridley Scott film that combines adventure with history and this is a good example of what Ridley Scott directed. The performances were great and outstanding, especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, the screenplay was very good, the cinematography amazing and the soundtrack is fascinating and what stands out most about the film. I have no doubt that this is RIDLEY SCOTT'S MASTERPIECE.",gladiator
"I didn't watch this in the cinema when it came out. I thought it sounded silly. On my first watch, I ejected the DVD after ten minutes because of the historical inaccuracies. However, a lot of people *love* this movie so I thought I should give it a second go. It's... OK. I think a lot of fans give it high ratings because of the fight scenes but I found them underwhelming because of the overuse of CGI and fast cuts. On the plus side, the acting is top-notch. It was good to see Richard Harris and Oliver Reed in another historical drama.",gladiator
Gladiator is brilliant! Incredible story and performances from the entire cast! Not many movies are able to capture or obtain what Gladiator achieved. A movie that will stay for generations!,gladiator
"A quest for vengeance of injustice. A bloody spectacle that brings into question the exploitation of death for enjoyment. It's not bringing anything new to the table, but with production quality of this magnitude, who cares?",gladiator
"Direction and cast are excellent in this accurate portrayal of Roman gladitorial combat along with the political intrigue of it all. The Battle of Germania was one of my favorite on screen battle scenes and the character of Maximus is brought out by Crowe's steely, soulful performance.",gladiator
"I think ""The gladiator"" is a really nice movie. It is well made, well filmed and well acted. I recommend it as long as you are not a perfectionist when it comes to historical accuracy, but overall it is great.",gladiator
Absolutely insane this movie doesn't have a higher score. Someone thought it was tedious? This movie is gripping the entire runtime. Something else about the director trying to force his world on the viewer or something is illogical as well.,gladiator
An entertaining if predictable historical epic with excellent visuals and an engaging villain. For a movie about gladiators the action is pedestrian. Generally fun but unworthy of best picture.,gladiator
"Aside from a few dull scenes that slowed down the film as well as some minor elements that didn't make a ton of sense, this film was an enjoyable time for both my eyes and ears! Hans Zimmer's score along with much of the cinematography and directing of action scenes, plus for sure Joaquin Phoenix's incredible acting, made this film what it is. This is the first sword and sandals film that I have seen and I can see why some might consider it the best one!",gladiator
"Gladiator is the epic story of a general who is enslaved and forced to fight in the Coliseum in a low fantasy world loosely based on the Roman Empire. Jokes about the complete lack of historical accuracy aside, Gladiator has some strong points - Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) makes for a decent villain, the camerawork is strong, and the action, while occasionally spoiled by the dated slow-motion effects, is satisfying. Unfortunately, the screenplay is entirely unbefitting a Best Picture winner. It is full of pseudo-profundities and is unnecessarily depressing, fridging the main character's family almost immediately in the most horrific way possible. Worse, the awful events Maximus experiences provoke little character development beyond making him a bit bitter. He is not the only one with vague characterization: the screenplay provides little in the way of coherent character motivations for the actors (save perhaps Phoenix) to work with, and perhaps consequently, almost every line is delivered like a speech or soliloquy even when this is inappropriate for the context. Gladiator is an alright film if you want to turn your brain off and enjoy the sights, but critics often present the film as intellectually-engaging art, a modern Spartacus, which it most definitely is not.",gladiator
"I'm a big ole sucker for self-serious political philosophizing, and the line Rome straddles between continued tyranny under the sole hands of an emperor or a renewed republic with power restored to the senate provides ample opportunity for this. I'm also a sucker for Russel Crowe scowling on a revenge quest. I'm also a sucker for the performer-audience relationship within combat sports, and this film actively plays on that with ""the Spaniard"" becoming a renown fan-favorite of the Coliseum-going populace. Effective in many more ways that not.",gladiator
"You can never go wrong with this movie. Whether you are a history fan and love the Romans, or you love raw action movies. This movie has it all. Personally, I love both, and my name is Maximilian, so hearing my name be chanted during the movie gives me my own dopamine boost. This movie will never get old. A truly classic movie. And for you history lovers, it is one of the most accurate ""Hollywood"" depictions of Rome.",gladiator
"The very best of both Phoenix and Crow. Gladiator is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made. Bot the acting and casting is spot on and at moments will move you to tears. I could go into dept here but this movie, how much you could talk about it, has to be experienced. On par with the greats like titanic, scareface, etc ... truly a must watch!",gladiator
"Good production, but it won't raise my rating, because I hated this story. Contrived and unnecessary, makes it uninteresting and predictable. What a waste of time.",gladiator
"Looking back, it's been a pretty violent week in terms of film watching for me. I hadn't seen Gladiator for seventeen years, and I've wondered for a long time whether I would hold it in the same high regard I did as a fourteen year old. Especially as the last Ridley Scott film I saw was another of his historical epics, the directors cut of Kingdom Of Heaven (2005), which was boring bordering on insulting. Orlando Bloom sank the film like one of the many boulders falling to the ground in the films' action sequences, which served as a far too infrequent alarm clock for me throughout its seeming three day run time. Gladiator, thankfully, is every bit as impressive the second time round. Ridley Scott has always been a fabulous world builder, (that includes Kingdom Of Heaven) and his vision of Rome is staggering. Russell Crowe can be a figure of ridicule at times, but is on mellowed, low key, Oscar winning form here, and he is terrific. It's not often that a film with so many action fight sequences can hold you on the edge of your seat for all of them, but Gladiator achieves this in spades, and is genuinely thrilling. Joaquin Phoenix is pitifully creepy and superbly effective as the villainous Commodus, and Connie Nielsen provides excellent support, alongside the late Richard Harris in a small role. Apart from perhaps The Martian (2015), it's a long time since Scott has been on top form, and Gladiator reminds you of how good he can be.",gladiator
"I believe this is my second time watching this movie (at least, fully) and my score has gone up. This movie is designed and executed so well. Because they were smart in how to mix practical with digital effects, the effect hold up even 21 years later. The first time I believe I watched the extended edition and this time I watched the director's preferred theatrical edition, and that seems to have improved my impression of the storytelling. There's a lot to love here.",gladiator
"A fantastic film with lessons about honor, responsibility, courage and family. Ever seconds of this film are filled with epic scenes, quite brutal, ruthless fights and drama.",gladiator
"After a recent watch, Gladiator only proved to me that it was better 22 years ago. Timing, style and a push from the Academy helped this film out more than some care to admit, but the ones who did the head-bob in the theater more than once during the 155 minute running time and are still doing it know exactly what's up.",gladiator
Movie switches gracefully between paced plot and high action. Easy to lose yourself in this period piece and enjoy the ride except for the lackluster ending.,gladiator
"Superbly acted, brilliantly edited, packs an action-paced punch and an engaging story to keep the audience thrilled, even if it loses some pace during the middle.",gladiator
Everyone needs to watch Gladiator. It deserved every award that it received and more. Quite possibly my favorite movie ever filmed. This should be the gold standard for movies.,gladiator
"Russell Crowe's big break for a reason, there's a simple but epic story told here. It's very Shakespearean as the characters are prisoners of their destiny.",gladiator
I enjoy many things about this movie. Too bad the acting sucks and the music makes me want to shove a twizzler in my ear,gladiator
"""My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius"" This movie is a glittering example of honor, virtue and masculinity. There is a slight flattening of characters into good or evil, but in this case it clarifies the examples for the audience. In addition, the historical context is interesting on a personal level, and the political intrigue of the Roman republic vs Empire adds to my understanding of the period (even if there is little actual basis in history).",gladiator
"It's understandable that many find Gladiator a great movie, but I'm not one of them. It certainly has its moments, but too often the story drags to a virtual halt and can be a bit of a slog to get through, whether it is the political shenanigans, the repetitive gladiator battles, or the excessive dialogue throughout. The gladiator scenes should have been the most compelling but are, more often than not, simply tiring as the scenes are edited with an MTV-like mentality, most of the shots lasting about an average of one second, barely enough time to compute what is being seen. The story itself is compelling and the performances are decent, but his could have been so much more than what it is.",gladiator
"Another well-deserved Best Picture winner finally visited to witness how the familiarly formulaic guarantee scope of rejuvenated genre interest signified by questionably conflicting decisions builds up an epic story of a fallen general rising up to stand against tyrannical power. Clear traits match the acclaimed yet dated patterns beneath the aforementioned category whereas the art gets dramatically furthered by the essence of beauty enabled by the excellent cast's strong performances depicting levels of humanity and through production merits from music to cinematography editing that seemingly modernizes the honored storytelling tribute director Ridley Scott aimed for as one of his more powerful, impactful feats. (B+)",gladiator
"Another film that I'm glad I got the chance to finally see. Really well done action scenes, great performances from everyone involved, and a surprisingly emotional core behind it.",gladiator
"Ridley Scott dirige un kolossal storico a cui non manca nulla tra guerra, amore, vendetta ed amicizia. Russell Crowe interpreta un personaggio che resterà nella storia del cinema e Joaquin Phoenix si dimostra una volta di più un fuori classe. Il montaggio sonoro e la colonna sonora sono sensazionali, così come i costumi e la sceneggiatura. I comprimari e qualche piccolo difetto di regia, stonano leggermente con i protagonisti, soprattutto se rivisti a qualche anno di distanza, ma fortunatamente per loro, il magnetismo della lotta tra Massimo e Comodo oscura ogni altro possibile difetto. Molto ben eseguite tutte le sequenze di battaglia, che si tratti di vera guerra o di confronto nelle arene. Un film iconico, di quelli che pur non senza difetti, resteranno impressi nel cinema e nel cuore degli appassionati per la sua epicità e per la capacità di sprigionare fortissime emozioni.",gladiator

"An all time american masterpiece of cinema. A top 20 film of my personal list of all time. This film single-handedly was the reason I formed an appreciation and interest for ancient history, ancient cultures and great ancient battles from long ago. This epic had a profound and powerful impact on me as I turned 14 when it came out. Directed magnificently by Ridley Scott, for which he won best director oscar. And of course, Russell Crowe, playing the unforgettable Maxumus, dessmes merideius himself for which, also, he won a best actor oscar for his portrayal as the Gladiator himself.",gladiator
"The critic ratings on here make zero sense. They give ""I Care a Lot' 80% but Gladiator only 70 something. See this all the time where the audience score / reality is so far detached from the critics consensus.",gladiator
"I just watched this again almost 20 years on from when it was made and cried my eyes out. It is really amazing. The soundtrack sounds a lot like pirates of the caribean that came a few years later. Nobody really stands out because it's all so well done. Writing, performances, cinematography, soundtrack - everything is as solid as a roman legionary. It winds up as beautiful, stoic, and emotional. The pace is consistent and though the effects are not flawless, they are executed conservatively so that they very much hold up against most modern movies. As timeless as sandals, but much more exciting.",gladiator
"A massive project with Ridley Scott's revival of the Sword & Sandal genre with Gladiator. This was Ridley Scott at the start of the digital age and his first colossal success since Thelma and Louise. Even then it managed to top that. It carried expectations with its overall marketing, starring one of the biggest stars in the world at that point Russell Crowe and would be the first of a handful of collaborations between Crowe and Scott. Pretty much putting Scott back on form after several financial misfires. At the height of the Roman Empire under the rule of Marcus Aurelius, his general Maximus, played by Crowe, leads his army to conquer and secure the nation of Germania with great success. Emperor Aurelius, nearing the end of his life, believes the political state of Rome has been corrupted. Primarily by morally backwards senators and his own son and heir to be, Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix. Aurelius entrusts Maximus with leading the city of Rome because of his loyalty, but Maximus instead seeks to return to his family after time in battle. Commodus gets wind of this and in his madness becomes upset and kills Aurelius in an embrace and frames Maximus for the crime – sentencing him to be executed. Maximus escapes with his life and rides to find his family brutally murdered by Commodus's men. Left bereft, his wounded self is captured by slave traders. Who sell him to a head gladiator trainer, Proximus played by Oliver Reed who reluctantly trains him to survive in the Gladiator Arena. Proving himself popular with the crowd, they move to the colosseum in Rome where the now Commodus reins emperor to little appeal amongst the senators. Maximus confronts Commodus in the arena and declares he will use what he can to avenge his family, no matter what. Even with the first scene of the battle to conquer Germania, you can get a real feeling of what you're in for. The sequence alone has plenty of sword cleaving, heads rolling, plenty of Braveheart-esque action that it's hard to look away. All the battle sequences - whether here or in the arena are particularly brutal. Choreographed in a way that genuinely makes them authentic and genuine of the period. Backed by the spectacle on-screen is a barnstorming central performance from Russell Crowe. Who really made his name across the world with this film and clearly seeks to take centre stage amongst the rest of the cast and the drama unfolding. With Joaquin Phoenix playing the central antagonist as effectively foolhardy. He plays him as the most exceptional combination of mad and pathetic that I ever have seen and for that, it's entertaining. The film went through several re-writes and production problems, and because of that, the film is far from perfect. There is the dialogue in this film such as the trailer line from earlier like, ""Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife. And I will have my revenge, in this life or the next"" or ""There was a dream that was Rome. It shall be released"" that I can't tell if they're genius or plain silly – so I'm settling for both. There are notably CGI inputs within the film. Clearly, are added due to time or unfortunate circumstances that occurred during the production such as Oliver Reed's untimely death halfway through shooting or the remodelling of the Coliseum. With that and Reed's computer-generated death scene, it stands out as jarring. There is a lot of Roman political discussions behind the scenes and does get bogged down with the major plot with Maximus and his revenge. There is a subplot involving Derek Jacobi's senator Gracchus who wants to overthrow Commodus to restore order. However, it primarily takes a step back and is used to move the plot forward through its three hour running time. While there are noticeable flaws that do question its best picture win at the Oscars. Gladiator has enough spectacle, breathtaking scenes of brutal pathos, battle choreography and style that recalls the most influential films of the classic Sword & Sandal genre. It has performers that either act to the point of the camp and those that give the film a really epic and dramatic scope. I really enjoyed this film; while there is enough to take issue with it, the film is so grand on many feats. With Russell Crowe happily taking the challenge of centre stage and leading the proceedings under Ridley Scott's firm direction.",gladiator
This movie is as good as everyone says it it. This film.....I cannot say anything about nobody else has. It is just fantastic and is a Masterpiece. Please do yourself a favor and watch this movie.,gladiator
"Thank goodness this movie secured Russell Crowe's stardom because otherwise, it would be totally pointless. He's amazing (""Are you not entertained?"") but I could take or leave the rest of it. Joaquin Phoenix as an abusive, incestuous villain will make your teeth crawl and your skin stand on edge. But for what?",gladiator
"The story is gold with little knicks here and there with how it’s delivered. That gives people who critique something to do.

"Se dice que el cerebro humano es una máquina y siendo así el caso, toda máquina siempre tiene a alguien o algo que la controla o la guía. Muchas veces pensamos que es nuestra capacidad de razonar lo que permite controlar nuestra voluntad, pero la capacidad de razonar es solo una herramienta que rara vez usamos y se vincula más con las ideas. Lo que realmente llega a controlar nuestra voluntad no siempre es la razón o nuestra consciencia, sino las emociones que suelen ser un estímulo vinculado a nuestro cerebro. Las emociones son un medio que detona muchas cosas que yacen en nuestro cerebro, como el instinto, la razón o la consciencia. Esto a veces da lugar a la ilusión de que tenemos consciencia de lo que hacemos y que tenemos la capacidad de decidir por nosotros mismos. Pero así como los animales siempre se guían por el instinto, con los humanos pasa lo mismo y son las emociones las que nos hacen actuar de forma consciente o inconsciente. Es todo un tema debido a que las emociones pueden hacernos reflexionar sobre nuestras acciones o nublar nuestra capacidad de pensar con lógica. Lo cierto es que las emociones son un arma de doble filo y estas se nutren de experiencias o estímulos externos para ir moldeando lo que sería la personalidad de cada individuo. Inside Out es una película asombrosa que retrata eso a la perfección y es un ejemplo muy claro sobre la psicología infantil. Aunque el número de emociones que yacen en la mente humana son muchas, la película solo utiliza las que son más relevantes. Las emociones escogidas se ven representadas en Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust y Anger. Son emociones que tienen bastante peso en la mente de un niño y son la elección ideal para explorar la mente de Riley. Joy es la emoción con más importancia debido a la alegre infancia que Riley ha tenido. Esta niña fue criada con amor y cariño en el ambiente más feliz y sano que los niños más afortunados podrían tener. Esa agradable experiencia es lo que forja las islas que definen la personalidad establecida de Riley y Joy tiene un liderazgo estable debido a que ella se vuelve parte fundamental de la personalidad de Riley. Las cosas se salen de control cuando la familia se muda y Riley trata de adaptarse a un entorno que desconoce. Aquí vemos como sus emociones comienzan a entrar en conflicto, principalmente Joy y Sadness. Joy hace un esfuerzo para mantener a Riley estable debido a que es una emoción muy enfocada al optimismo. Trata de mantener a Sadness a distancia para evitar que afecte de forma negativa a Riley. Pero Joy va entendiendo después que la tristeza es una emoción inevitable porque cuando sentimos un dolor emocional, no se puede evitar los deseos de llorar. Cuando Sadness toca los recuerdos alegres de Riley y se tornan azul, es un claro significado de como nuestros recuerdos más felices pueden hacernos llorar por la nostalgia que provocan. Joy y Sadness son como las dos caras de la misma moneda y es que no puede haber alegría sin tristeza o viceversa. Este conflicto entre ambas hacen que queden de lado al quedar fuera del centro de comando y sin Joy estando presente, Riley debe lidiar con las demás emociones. Fear, Anger y Disgust no pueden replicar la alegría que Joy transmitía y ahí se complica todo. Aquí vemos muy claramente lo que un niño siente cuando es alejado de su hogar al que tanto estaba aferrado. El miedo, la ira y el disgusto son las emociones que más se manifiestan y por eso estas son las que terminan al mando de la mente de Riley. Al no tener una pizca de alegría presente que la ayude a lidiar con su nuevo entorno, Riley se va sucumbiendo más a la decepción. Literalmente su mundo se viene abajo y eso provoca que las islas que definen su personalidad se vayan derrumbando. La película hace una fiel representación del derrumbe mental que puede sufrir un niño tras irse del hogar donde fue feliz. La película tiene muchos elementos cargados de significados psicológicos que la hacen bastante profunda. Uno de esos elementos son los recuerdos como grabaciones que quedan archivadas en nuestro cerebro y que también contribuyen a la construcción de la personalidad. También hay elementos como los sueños, la imaginación o los miedos profundos que también juegan un papel en la psicología. Más allá de ser una película infantil con momentos de comedia, tiene un ingenioso concepto que sirve para entender más a fondo la psicología de un niño que pasa por un momento de infelicidad. Lo que hace al final es dar a entender que la tristeza no es algo que se pueda evadir o remediar al instante. Las acciones de Joy son iguales a las de una madre o una amiga que trata de animar a alguien que está triste. La solución no es intentar hacer reír al niño triste, sino comprenderlo y consolarlo. Joy comienza a darse cuenta de eso cuando Sadness consola a Bing Bong. Entiende que la tristeza es parte de la mente de Riley y no puede dejarse de lado así como si nada. La tristeza puede ser algo doloroso de sentir, pero es algo que todos sentimos en algún momento. Eso es lo que activa esa sensibilidad que nos define como seres sintientes. No sentir tristeza no es del todo posible porque siempre hay aunque sea una pequeña pizca de ella en nuestro interior. No sentir tristeza significaría no tener ninguna otra emoción y eso nos haría seres vacíos. Tanto las emociones positivas como negativas son parte de la programación de nuestro cerebro y sin ellas, solo quedaría la lógica que actúa de una manera más fría y neutral. Al final, el comportamiento humano no es tan complejo una vez entendiendo la maquinaria del cerebro, es solo que actúa diferente según cada individuo y por eso las posibilidades son variadas. Pero Inside Out toma algo básico que requiere de bastante explicación y lo muestra de una manera bastante fácil de entender. Eso hace que Inside Out sea una de las mejores películas que abordan el terreno psicológico. Su mundo caricaturesco de la mente de Riley es una muy buena representación de la mente de un niño y la animación jamás decepciona al momento de crear una experiencia visual asombrosa. Pixar siguió manteniendo intacto su capacidad de crear una obra de arte animada con una historia profunda. Inside Out es otro logro que está a la altura de muchas de las grandes películas que Pixar ha producido. Es recomendable tanto como película para toda la familia como un ejercicio de psicología infantil. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10.",insideout

"JUANITA RONDON In my opinion, Inside Out is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I really liked it because it's not only funny, but it also has a very profound message about emotions. Sometimes we think we should just be happy all the time, but this film shows that all emotions play an important role in our lives, even sadness. I thought it was really beautiful how, through Riley's story, we understand that feeling fear, anger, or sadness isn't wrong, and that sometimes we need to feel these things in order to learn, heal, and grow. I also loved how they depicted the human mind, with memories, personality islands, and the headquarters where emotions work.

There are so many funny, expressive, heartfelt moments and characters that make this film an absolute Joy to revisit. It's not one of Pixar's absolute best, but it's pretty close.",insideout
"Such a fun and nostalgic movie—definitely worth a rewatch. It really took me back to how I felt when I was younger and did a great job deepening Riley’s character. The emotional moments hit hard, and the story balances heart and humor in a way that sticks with you. A strong sequel that adds even more depth to the world we loved the first time around.",insideout
Divertida mente foi o melhor filme que a pizza já criou os emoções que todo mundo sente quando for fase do pré-adolescente o filme traz grandes emoções grandes coisas que a gente vai aprendendo de fazer pra pré-adolescente e foi o maior filme da Disney Pixar e foi um dos filmes que muita gente gostou de ver nos cinemas com os filhos recomendo muito para assistir amei o filme ❤️👍,insideout
"I've watched this movie many, many times since it's release, from age 15 to now 25. Everytime I watch it, I develop a new way of being able to teaching myself the importance of my emotions and the impact it has on not only myself but the people around me. I will cherish this movie forever and recommend everyone to watch it.",insideout
"Arguably one of the best animated movies of all time. This movie has some stunning animation, amazing story telling, and is a heck of a Pixar film. Definitely deserves 98%",insideout
Did you know? Inside out is one of the best films ever made and if anyone says there’s anything wrong with this movie they’re wrong?,insideout
"This is my favourite animated movie of all time now I know it might be a bit cheap that my favourite animated movie of all time is a Disney movie but that’s exactly why it’s my favourite movie of allTime only Disney can make this movie you know what words can’t describe this movie As soon as I watched it again I remembered why it is my favourite animated movie of all time. It’s just magic If you haven’t watched it, you have to and your life will change forever I think Pixar And Disney have done it they’ve made the worlds best movie",insideout
"Very good movie i like the Morale that is ""do not be afraid of changes they aways come"" Very helpful to understand when we must feel the every emotion",insideout
"The film that became a classic immediately and inspired many avenues of mental health help and psychological therapy. This movie is taught in classrooms and has a footprint on even our conversations. Often times I will see a comment on Facebook or a video on YouTube and they will mention the phrase “core memory” in passing. This movie is the reason that concept even exists. Even as a movie, it is wonderful, light, and emotional with a really creative and outstanding plot. All of the characters feel so warm and loveable, and the fun and creativity to simply explain complex emotions and thought is unmatchable to any other movie that tried. It was Pixar’s modern masterpiece and it’s always been a very easy film to watch anytime of the day or year.",insideout
"Intensamente: increible, la película pudo lograr muchos sentimientos aparte demostrar increíbles detalles sobre la mente humana y sobre explicarlo de una manera muy creativa y humorística. la animación de esta es muy original y creativa",insideout
"It’s an alright movie. It’s sucks that Bing Bong died, wish he got his wish and be remembered. I honestly wish there was an antagonist monster called the forgotten that consumes memories or something.",insideout
This is a classic for the younger generation. Inside Out is every bit a Pixar fan's well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem. This is yet another Pixar classic.,insideout
Coming to age story. Wonderful and beautiful. Feel good story. It pictures the emotions that live inside a little girls head. Really good. One of my favorites 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿/5 on Disney +,insideout
"Insideout It talks about Insideout .It’s an animation and family,comdey movie.It’s set in San Francisco.It’s talking about some feelings that control actions and reactions.The main character is Riley.It starts Caitlin Diaz .there is a sequel to this movie called Insideout2 In my opinion,the animation was amazing and attractive .the soundtrack was really good and impressive.And the voice actors were also great.The after effects were wonderful.the story was enjoyable, interesting and existing.And the idea was creative and beautiful, the characters were so funny.The first scene was absorbing .And the ending was not bad.",insideout
"This film,while the story and concept is relatively simple on paper, the unique world and characters keep it interesting and it has sweet messages that can really resonate with an audience. I liked the personalities of the different emotions and the islands were very nice. Then the montages and memories of kid Riley really resonated with me and made me cry on a few occasions. The story of growing up,moving on and letting things go embodied by the story of Bing Bong and the fading memories was very powerful. That isn't even the main message,the main message is that sadness can be beneficial and necessary at times while too much optimism can be harmful at times as, but both are important. This film depicts that true joy can only be achieved through a mix of happy and sad moments and I like how that is reflected in Joy’s design. Her skin is gold but her hair is blue and her dress is a light green combination of the two (blue for sadness, gold for joy). I also just really like the trombone sound they use for sadness, at the beginning I thought that was worth mentioning. I also thought it was very realistic that in the stressful situations Riley copes with hostility,fear,and sarcasm. Then the last thing I want to touch on was how the family is betrayed in this film. I thought they found it a good job of portraying a healthy family dynamic that's realistic but also amusing to watch and is very supportive.",insideout
"It was an entertaining, beautiful and funny movie. It was also very nice in terms of visual effects. Graphics were also good. It's also fun to watch. I haven't watched the second movie yet, but I think it's good too.",insideout
"This movie is one of the best pixar movies ever mabe. I like the characters in this movie (l most liked sadness), l like the amazing idea, and too the pretty world in rilie's head.l like the story about how joy learned how to appreciate sadness and anyway i like anything in this movie. Watch it right now.",insideout
"Filme: Divertidade Mente 2 ivertidamente Assistido: 21-10-24 Modelo: esenho ventura rama Duração: 1h 36m Ano: 2024 Minha opinião: Um desenho inteligente que a critica elogiou e publico também. Agora riley é uma adolecente a fase infantil com seus sentimentos e agora surgem novos sentimentos. Tristeza, Alegria, Raiva, Medo, Nojinho, e novos Ansiedade, Tédio, Vergonha e Inveja. A descoberta destes novos sentimentos na sua formação adolescentes que é a base para sua formação adulta. E seus sentimentos serão novamente confrontados. Seu eu de base com seu eu de mudança. E são momentos que as emoções novas tentam suprimir as emoções já existente. Um bom filme reflexivo sobre nossa emoções, onde pode direcionar o nosso caracter na vida adulta. Pois isso faz parte da excencia de cada um. E como enfrentar novas emoções e saber que as pessoas com quem nos relacionamos tem um peso na nossa própria formação. E claro os conflitos com os pais principalmente nesta fase. Este é um desenho que não é para as crianças para os adultos também. Roteiro e enredo muito inteligente. Vale apena assistir? Sim Nota: 8",insideout
"One of the best animated movies out there. And as all great animated movies, it's one that both adults and children can enjoy and relate to. Whoever wrote the script deserves several awards. You won't be disappointed with this one.",insideout
"A great movie for the family to watch together! ""Inside Out""s characters each represent (and are named after) 'big feelings' that children have, helping kids to learn about their own emotions while being entertained. I recommend parents watch this with their children, as it's a fun learning experience for all.",insideout
What a unique take on the inner machinations of one's mind! I thought this movie was a lot of fun and I loved all the interpretations of the psyche-- like portraying imaginary friends or dreams or how memories work. It also had me crying multiple times throughout the film-- definitely a good watch for kids and adults alike!,insideout
"Parents need to know that Inside Out is an outstandingly original, heartfelt story from Pixar about growing up and learning to handle your biggest emotions.",insideout
"This is amazing! The concept of this movie is very nice and it's so cool that it's so related to psychology. The OST is from another world, the animation is very well-done and the script is very good. Every person and their inside outs should watch this masterpiece!",insideout
"Pixar does basic psychology. Excellent movie. Top 3 for Pixar, I was pleasantly surprised. Take a look at the hateful audience reviews... evidence that we're surrounded by psychopaths.",insideout
"I'm not happy Joy. NOT. HAPPY. ASK ME WHY. Why what? Be specific Joy, why am I unhappy? The 98% Rotten Tomatoes score makes me unhappy, but the positive reviews I can handle. But what I can't handle is your family's inexplicable knowledge on Riley Andersen's inner workings. They're experts, experts Joy! Exploiting every loophole dodging every obstacle, they're penetrating Riley's mind. We're supposed to help our emotions, Starting with our core memories Joy, who's helping that out, huh?",insideout
Inside Out is the Pixar movie with the best concept ever. The characters are really solid and the plot makes the concept effective (a thing that isn't the same with Elemental),insideout
This is a wonderful movie its the perfect movie to talk about expressing yourself in different ways. I also love that Sadness is the true hero and helps Riley express how she feels about a tough change important message ❤ 💙 💜 💚💛,insideout
"Inside Out leans heavily on metaphors relatable to young children, making it often visually unappetizing for older audience members, though a well-written story pulls it together in the end.",insideout
"Decided to watch after seeing the buzz surrounding “Inside Out 2”. Simply incredible, provoking emotions and self-thought at multiple levels. I have watched all of the Pixar classics and this is right up there, anyone and everyone will enjoy this!",insideout
"Possibly the most insightful movie ever made, Inside Out takes the uncharted waters of what it looks like inside our heads, and explores. At every turn there is new food for thought, and the movie playfully approaches so many different aspects of what goes on behind the brain. The movie tells a compelling story while telling us so much about ourselves. A rare gem.",insideout
"I love it SOOOOOOO much, my favorite character for 1 movie, joy, sadness, for 2, ennui, sadness, embarrassment, joy, for anybody who has watched it, MUST SEE Inside Out 2!!!",insideout
"INSIDE OUT is inventive, imaginative, psychologically astute and almost certainly deeply beneficial for helping kids (and adults) develop better self-awareness. It's remarkable how well this films works, and it's both a brilliant storytelling strategy and a philosophically profound insight that it all begins with inner Joy.",insideout
It's good movie but I feel like it goes on for to long and the storyline gets a bit boring but I have seen this movie about 50 times soo,insideout
Inside out Is super sad It’s Enough To Make A grown Man Cry 😭 And That’s Ok My 10 Year Old Cried So much During This movie Reminds me Of the emoji movie A litte bit,insideout
Having watched this film i thought it was a great pixar film. The whole concept is interesting and it really made a good impression. Shame that the sequel didn't quite live up to its hype.,insideout
"uma obra de arte da pixar. sempre que reassisto não me contenho e choro. esse filme tem muitas camadas profundas que mexe com a memória de cada um de nós, no meu caso foi de nostálgica da infância, e ao longo do filme você vai junrando as peças, e quando o filme termina parece que você se liberta daquilo que estava guardado de dentro da gente. simplesmente incrível este filme, não sei como o público deu essa nota tão baixa, esperava mais das pessoas!",insideout
"Hay muchos aspectos que tiene esta fantástica película, el concepto de la mente de riley es perfecta, tiene un hermoso mensaje y en efecto, es cine 🚬",insideout
The movie is bad the movie is boring and half of the movie is about a emo depressed goth girl and the movie only suggests at a school,insideout
"To be honest, I'd never had the time or interest to watch this back in 2015 whether in theaters or on DVD. But with interest along with Inside Out 2 in theaters, I finally got myself the chance to see the first and it is what everyone says it to be, whether from critics or audiences. A charming, imaginative and emotional roller coaster of a movie. With the moral of the story being highly important for both kids and adults along with letting some things go as we have to grow up in life. Sure, there are a couple of things that does get corny. But thankfully, there are only a few of them and does not get in the way of the story and the moral. From the animation to the voice cast loads of laughs and understanding the story, this was certainly worth a watch regardless of age. 10/10",insideout
"""Inside Out"" is a vibrant, imaginative journey into the mind of an 11-year-old girl, where emotions take center stage. The film's unique concept and stunning animation are matched by its heartfelt storytelling. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, each with their own distinct personalities, guide us through Riley's emotional landscape as she navigates a life-changing move. The film deftly balances humor and poignancy, exploring complex themes of loss, change, and the importance of embracing all emotions. ""Inside Out"" is a must-see for all ages, a touching reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope.",insideout
First time of seeing this film. Don’t know why I’ve not seen it before. Really enjoyed it. Very clever and may try and catch the sequel in the cinema.,insideout
"This movie is almost perfect, although the scenes that Joy and Sadness share seem long. Bing Bong's death is one of the saddest of Disney-Pixar.",insideout
"Light hearted watch about the different emotions that go on inside each person. In this case, the main character was Riley, and we follow her as she grows into a young child. Her emotions grow chaotic when her family decides to move from Minnesota to San Francisco. In the end, the lesson learned is that all of the emotions are important, work together, and are valid. Her family supports her as she expresses how she misses Minnesota. But they don't move back. Inside a person, it's also cute how there are different islands/memories: family, friendship, goofiness, the sport you love, etc.",insideout
"Such a sweet movie, it explains anxiety and moods at a basic level but so well done for everyone to understand and connect with it. Simple, sweet, and entertaining a must watch for all ages. Will heal your inner child.",insideout
Not a top five favorite Pixar movie of mine . Haven't seen this since it was in theaters. Gearing up to go see the second one. Crazy to think there was going to be 20-27 emotions in the early draft script. I love Bill Hader voicing Fear. My favorite character. This is a 7.3/10 it's really good. Maybe the second one will be better who knows.,insideout
"Inside Out is one of the best movies! My favorite character is honestly Sadness because shes the one who always stops Riley from making terrible decisions, if it wasnt for Anger, Riley wouldnt be depressed! The lesson is sometimes you cant always be happy, and family is always important",insideout
Hard not to love. Only justification for not giving it 5 stars was the fact that I thought Inside Out 2 was a slight improvement.,insideout
One of the most heartwarming and emotionally moving Pixar movies ever which makes this is a top tier Pixar film as well as an instant Pixar classic. This is a wonderful film that will delight viewers of all ages.,insideout
A really good film though I'm not as in love with it as everyone else seems to be. I usually don't mind plot holes but a lot of these are pretty infuriating for me for some reason.,insideout
"While Inside Out may be a good movie, with cool ideas and designs, the one thing I really hate about this movie is the running away stuff. Yes I know in the end Riely decides to go home and stay with her parents, but the simple fact is that what they do in the movie gives kids ideas they should not have put in their head. Like stealing your parents credit cards and going online to buy stuff, or in the movies case, buy a bus ticket to run away. This is something no child at a young age should have put in their head, especially if they decide to run away and do what Riely did in the movie, or buy stuff online and steal credit cards. Personally I wouldn't show this to my kids, or even encourage others to either. Running away, stealing, and sneaking around are not things young kids need to have put in their minds!",insideout
"The type of movie that you would enjoy watching as a child, only to find out its true ingenuity when you view it again as an adult.",insideout
This movie showcases on how the emotions work I rate it a 10/10 i would highly recommend you to watch it with your family (Its also perfectly for family movie night),insideout
"Lo realmente valorable de la película, es que busca más de un pensamiento diferente para que puedas identificarte con el personaje o el tipo de situación que vive. Logras ver bien como la protagonista trata de adaptarse a un ambiente diferente y como va poco a poco sintiendo que no es su hogar,. Algo que es muy destacable porque así siempre es la primera semana de mudanza, pero muestra que hablando no se arregla el problema de una vez, pero si genera más consciencia y entendimiento frente la situación, lo que hace que con el tiempo puedas dejar de sentirte solo y puedas aceptar y con el tiempo, valorar el cambio. Quisiera poder darle 5 estrellas, pero hay momentos donde se siente un poco genérica, pero en general la película, es una de mis favoritas de Pixar desde que la vi.",insideout
"I thought this was fantastic in every way. Has a father with a 12 year old child on the spectrum it left for many interesting and relating conversations on the way home. It's really easy to get a sequel wrong, but whoever was in charge of this movie and the imagination that they put into it nailed it. It wasn't really good it was great. Whoever was in charge of making this movie from beginning to end should be in charge of the rest of Disney. I'm actually shocked they didn't mess this one up. Five stars easy. I could write a five page paper on just how good it was.",insideout
"Almost perfect in every way. The humor is amazingly clever, the different locations are interesting and make sense, and the story is top tier. I can't think of a complaint, especially since Inside Out 2 fixed my only one being the lack of fear, disgust, and anger.",insideout
"Absolute Cinema! This film deserves 367 Oscars! Inside Out is a Children's Film, But with a Lust for Swearing, Well, I didn't find any problem with this wonderful film, if you've seen it, I don't think it's a mistake, I know that Inside Out 2 was released, but anyway , my rating;10.0, This film is beautiful because we see that we can't stay happy forever, but we also can't stay sad forever.",insideout
One of the better children's movies ever made. I actually used clips from this film for teaching purposes when I was an elementary school teacher.,insideout
A wonderful sequel to a wonderful movie. This really tackles true emotion and puts it in a way children understand. These movies have helped my daughter open up about her feelings.,insideout
"This intelligent and thoughtful masterpiece never ceases to amaze me in the way it can grab your emotions and force you to feel things while telling a beautiful engrossing story, ending with some of the most beautiful moments in Pixar’s history (which is a HIGH bar). I notice new little details each time I watch it like the disgust cat barfing in the background of the credit sequence. i am excited for the sequel arms have heard great things. 9.7/10",insideout
Had to take my son out of the cinema....cant i show my sin a movie in 2024 without the constant unsubtle messaging?? Will not watch another Pixar/Disney movie for a while after this.,insideout
"Excellent movie. Part 1 was my absolutely favorite Disney animated movie for a while. Riley has not just grown up on us she has shown us how we were all like her when younger. I can’t just separate the two films now. Part 2 also has great story telling and world building. Kudos to the writers, animators and the directors.",insideout
"Just watched this, and wow! What a fantastic film! Another triumph for Pixar. The story was engaging and truly tugs at the heartstrings, bringing me to tears a couple of times. Definitely worth watching!",insideout
"I avoided seeing this Pixar movie because it just seemed to meta, and I was right. I'd have preferred them just showing the story, I don't need to know about all the inner machinations of every single feeling this kid has, which seemed to just distract from the story and became tedious and boring, for me, a grown man, I couldn't imagine having to sit through this as a 5 year old. Though I actually saw it with a 5 year old and she seemed entertained enough so it might just be me. But I definitely would not recommend any other 5 year old seeing this over the many other awesome Pixar movies. I can't believe they made a sequel, where anxiety is introduced, no thanks!",insideout
"Even if the characters are underused and the story is too plain, this win from Pixar Animations can make you cry, laugh, and awe at its creativity, and even make you give outstanding praise towards the animation.",insideout
"Inside Out is the cream of the Pixar crop. It will stand the test of time, and is one of the best movies of all time, animated or otherwise.",insideout
"Inside Out is the greatest Pixar movie to see besides Toy Story of course, Inside Out gives you a vision of what our emotions look like from inside our heads.",insideout
What’s really amazing about INSIDE OUT is that you can have an incredibly amazing trip into the human mind and literally see how it all works. I couldn’t thank PIXAR enough for what they have accomplished in this film.,insideout
"O filme é totalmente encaixado, trazendo o telespectador rir, sorrir, chorar e se emocionar. De maneira lúdica, traz a temática dos sentimentos e das emoções à tona sem distinção para crianças e adultos, sendo um tipo de filme que toda a família irá gostar. A animação colabora com a interpretação do enredo e isso enche de alegria e de outras emoções o telespectador.",insideout
"Animated films often take a great concept and overfill it with unnecessary plot or action. Inside Out should be the framework for all animated film moving forward. It takes an unbelievably creative idea and weaves it perfectly into a 90-minute movie for children and adults alike without being too dull or over the top. The characters chosen are perfect to connect within the concept of the film. The voice actors chosen perfectly illustrate the range and definition of the emotion. Sadness and anger get the crowd laughing with their takes and the concept of happiness trying to take over life perfectly blends with how we think of reality. The movie itself achieves what all great movies do, its plot and storyline bleeds into our everyday life and has us talking for years down the road. I’ve thought of my five main core memories, and I bet after watching this film, you have to.",insideout
So clever in how it makes children aware of emotions and the importance of our mental health and communicating our thoughts and feelings. We love this film in our house.,insideout
"Inside out made me cry at least 2 times. It’s adorable, wholesome. It’s comedy is perfect, and it gives us a good life lesson. I love all the characters and emotions as well.",insideout
Pixars best films always know just how to hit you and Inside Out hits harder than most. A powerful story that just hits harder and harder.,insideout
"I thought this movie was going to be a preschool-vibed animated snooze-fest for adult and happy for kids, but I was wrong, This Movie is actually deep in it's own right, showing us metaphorically our emotions and mental health, its funny and entertaining, the scene where Riley emotionally tells her parents that she's homesick still manages to make me cry every time, and telling us that negative emotions can have a positive impact as we get older. plus some creativity of our inside of our brains and minds. Pixar seriously delivered it's emotional storytelling with this one 9.5/10",insideout
the only positive thing i remember about this movie is younger me going to take a dump after watching it. i wanted to kill sadness,insideout
"Helemaal geen slecht idee! Iedere emotie wordt gespeeld door een manneke/vrouwke en ook hun kleurheeft een betekenis. Niet slecht maar, net zoals Trolls, best geschikt voor de jongere Disney fan.",insideout
"This is probably the best movie I've watched during the movie. There are some cool moments. In the short story, the rally moves to another city, and the family's house is delayed by furniture from this rally, they have to sleep on the floor, then all the emotions start arguing what to do, and maybe we should leave, but then it happens that sadness and joy fall out of the brain department, but however they tried to return, but they couldn't do it, the poet wants to go back to the city, and he inserts the key into the remote control for a while, joy and sadness return, and sadness corrects everything, and emotions return to the rally, and everything becomes the way it was the end. the director made this film wonderful, and the acting was wonderful, and the characters were funny, the film is wonderful, my cookies are about positive films, I advise everyone",insideout
Considering I watched this when I was younger and still like it now is amazing. It's a kids movie but feels like a movie any child could relate to. The characters have such good designs and I love the animation.,insideout
"One of the most overrated movies from Disney/Pixar. The plot moves sluggishly. The characters are mostly annoying. Too slow for most kids, too juvenile for adults.",insideout
"I think that this kind of movies inevitably drives you to perceive the movie, as the consolidation of three main components: Riley's life (this is, excluding everything regarding the behavior and circunstances inside her mind), the characters inside her mind (in and of itself), and the interaction among these. About Riley, her individual story is, in truth, pretty simple, and it's far to be enough for support the movie (what is not inherently wrong), and the relationship with her humanized feeling is weak, but, on the other side, the most of the plot is about what happen in her head, and here the film reach its height. The universe built, is full of interesting and original aspects, that explain in a strinking way the working of the mind, unfortunaly, this also run, what, for me, is the most significant downside, the childish-approach that the movie is loaded with, it could be way better. Be that as it may, is a great movie, with a coherent development, recommendable altogether.",insideout
Inside out is a movie that is not just good but GREAT! It was really interesting and was sad at sometimes overall I would say this one of Disney's best movies ever made!,insideout
"I'm not kidding when I say this movie changed my life forever. Given that, it easily is my favorite Pixar (and possibly just general) movie. As a 13 year old at the time of the movies release, I had gone through exactly the same situation as Riley about a year prior to this movie coming out. My family had a rough move that took a serious toll on my mental state. At the time of the move, I had a hard time dealing with the change in school, friends, and location. When this movie came out, I was interested, but wasn't sure what to fully expect going in. There were some differences in the situation, but as a 12 year old, they felt very similar. You don't know how to emotionally cope with this until later down the road. This movie became the pillar I would lean on to help train myself for the sad times. Without this film, I don't know if I would be the person I am today, or even if I would be around today. 100/10, cannot recommend enough.",insideout
"It's cute to see Raily in her childhood and how she wakes up the others emotions. Step by step. Also, the imaginary boyfriend, always saying ""I'd do everything for Riley"" or something like that, for me it makes me laugh a lot.",insideout
This was a top tier movie for me for sure! The concept is brilliant and so entertaining. Just like all the characters you go through quite a rollercoaster of emotions. Defiantly worth a watch or 2.,insideout
"This movie is beautifully crafted. The way that it dives into the complex world of emotions and how they shape our experiences and perceptions of the world is simple and yet deep. The animation is colorful and vibrant, grabbing your attention immediately. The voice acting is top-notch from all involved, with each person bringing the right amount of every emotion needed to be believable. Kaitlyn Dias is great as Riley, especially! The music from Michael Giacchino also perfectly fits and enhances everything within the film. In the realm of themes, the concept of artistically visualizing the brain as a huge functioning factory-style workplace is a unique and intriguing idea. The exploration of core memories and how they can be affected by our emotions adds an extra layer of depth to the film that many may appreciate. One of the standout aspects of Inside Out is the message that all emotions are important and necessary. It is a message for people of all ages. The film also touches on the idea that we all have our own inner worlds and experiences that others may not understand. Overall, it is a heartwarming and thought-provoking film that is sure to become a new all-time favorite for many.",insideout
Inside Out has a nuanced and rather unique message and a lot of creative world-building - pretty impressive considering how convoluted the concept is. It's not a film I'll return to often but it certainly succeeds on its own merits.,insideout
ITS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE PLUS THE RED ONE ANGER IS REALLY FUNNY LIKE EVERY TIME HE EXPLODES I START LAUGHING MY ASS OFF 10/10,insideout
"I hadn't watched this movie in around 5 years, so I decided to rewatch it and I laughed at a ton of the adult jokes I didn't understand as a little kid like the Brazilian helicopter pilot bit",insideout
Inside Out is one of those rare gems that I can watch on repeat. My family and I can't wait until June 2024 when they release Inside Out 2.,insideout
"Comovente, inventivo, emocionante, cativante, e criativo. Novamente, a Pixar nos mostra seu potencial e sua criatividade sempre a postos para nós trazer maravilhas como esta.",insideout
"When I was 7, this was a good 8/10; there was nothing better at the time. Seeing colors and different emotions walk around being funny and crazy was a really cool thing for me at the time. I took a liking to the Fear character to the point of begging my mom for a plushie of him like any 7-year-old would do. Now, this movie is a solid 5/10. If I could rewatch it on Disney+, I would ask why we are on Disney+ in the first place. Stuff from Disney and Pixar has slowly faded out for me (with a few exceptions). When I watch an animated movie, I really only look at how smooth the animation is and if anything clips or bugs out and the animators didn't see it. Pixar did a great job, animation-wise. That is the only good thing I'll say about this movie.",insideout
"Stunning visuals, unique animation, amazing characters, Inside Out is easily one of Pixar's most iconic masterpieces in pop culture with a great voice cast and a heartfelt story, it is certainly a literal emotional roller coaster. 10/10",insideout
To see an American movie geared towards children that declares not only is sadness a vital emotion but also that anyone who is constantly joyous may very well lack empathy is not something I ever expected.,insideout
"Small spoiler warning!! This is straight up one of my favourite Pixar movies ever made. It's so good at capturing all the different emotions and how hard life change and growing up is. As a young girl, who is still struggling with having to let your childhood go this movie is nice to watch once in a while. Incredible small details, compelling characters and such a heartwarming and realistic ending. This movie also includes one of my all time favourite Disney characters, Bing Bong. Joy saying her final goodbyes to him was so heartbreaking to watch, but it also made sense for the story. This movie is definitely the textbook definition of this quote: ""If you are brave enough to say goodbye, life will reward you with a new hello."" This is a must watch for all ages in a nice family movie night! Easy 5 stars.",insideout
"Absolutely amazing movie. The soundtrack is calm yet amazing, the storyline is amazing, it has the perfect amount of funny moments and sad moments. 100% recommended.",insideout
"Simplesmente uma das melhores animações da Disney, um filme emocionante, lindo, com uma trilha sonora de arrepiar, uma história envolvente e camadas para cada personagem e ação muito interessante e profundos. Vale a pena não só ver uma vez, como duas, três, pois esse é aquele tipo de filme que cada vez que você assiste, melhora sua experiência, sensacional!!!",insideout
"Beautiful movie, probably the BEST Pixar movie EVER MADE (maybe except for Cars). It has some truly heartbreaking moments, that almost made me cry. Overall it is just a wonderful movie inside and out.",insideout
"‘Inside Out' follows Riley, a young girl who has just moved to San Francisco with her parents. Leaving her life in Minnesota behind. She and her five core emotions, Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear and Disgust, struggle to cope with her new life. I have a very sentimental attachment to this movie. I do believe it's one of the best films produced by Pixar so far. The emotional journey we see Riley go through in this movie, displayed in such creative ways is so touching. Transforming elements such as abstract thought and memory into a somewhat educational and effective format. Not only is the story and characters such a strong part of this movie, the animation and attention to detail is incredible. There is so much beautiful scenery and cinematography throughout the film. I couldn't recommend this movie enough! Whether it's to sit down with the family, or enjoying a quiet night in. This film is a must watch!",insideout
Es mejores películas de pixar me encanta la animación y también los son carismáticos y historia es muy profunda y la muerte de Bing bong es triste es un 9 de 10,insideout
"One of the best movies ever made. The Bing Bong narrative is enough to make a grown man cry. Fun for the whole family, and a strong candidate for the most re-watchable films of all time.",insideout
86% At first i wasn't a fan of this movie not watching it it's actually a really great story told with emotions which is so interesting how they did it and it's actually sad of what happens too it's just one character annoyed me for a lot of the movie is my one negative,insideout
"Inside Out is innovative and uncommonly relevant. By using delectable animation and generous humor, this movie explores intricate emotions without feeling technical or too sappy. It's intelligent, thoughtful, and delightful.",insideout
"Omg. I cannot stand sadness. Destroyed everything, didn't care let alone listen. I understand listening to your emotions but no one did in this movie. The best thing was the imaginary friend",insideout
"All Time Classic. Everything in this is masterfully done. The animation and colors is the highlight. The colors match perfectly the emotions of the moment beautifully without any words needed. This is perfectly paced and packs so much into a short 90 minute runtime. Super heartfelt and a mature message that being happy isn't the only emotion, but embracing all of them is part of being human. A truly timeless universal message for all ages. The humor is really good also and the characters are super charming. Anyone know matter what age should give this a watch.",insideout
"For me the best Pixar movie! When released I had almost the same age as Riley (I was 10) and I liked so much of it, but a year and half later (I was 11) it happened to me of moving on to another state too, and watching now (with 18) it happens to realize that I have been gone through everything Riley goes in the movie. All the new place, new school, miss the old friends, want to runaway (oh God, I really wanted to)... I can't stop crying when I watch this movie, I see me right there, but my life has become nothing, just sadness, I won't have a happy ending probably. 💙 This movie forever will be my favorite of all, I just love the feeling, the music and the accuracy of the movie, cause j lived exactly that and I can confirm that I had the same thoughts. I can't wait for the 2, I hope they don't spoil it. 💛",insideout
Inside Out is really inventive. This film addresses complex emotions without coming across as overly technical or sentimental because of its delicious animation and kind humour. It is very emotional and enjoyable.,insideout
"I watched it two times and it is the most creative movie from Pixar's 2010-2019 decade. This movie is emotional, never better said for what the plot stands for: The emotions. Original, for how we see them represented and working inside and out. And so, easy to empathize with the main, changing character. It's a very human and beautiful movie.",insideout
"Pixar managed again to move me almost to tears with a simple and relatable tale about growing up and the complexities of emotion, that is told with really inventive imagery.",insideout
"Inside Out shines as one of Pixar's best recent movies, ingeniously delving into the complexities of emotions with heart, humour, and visual brilliance, resulting in a profound and imaginative masterpiece that resonates with audiences of all ages.",insideout
I'm in the minority here but I personally didn't like this movie. The idea is weird and the whole thing feels like some sort of fever dream to me.,insideout
"Like any good Pixar movie, viewers, parents especially, will laugh, cry, and laugh while they're crying. Inside Out is still decidedly a kids movie even if the parents likely get far more out of it than the kids. This one formed a ""core memory"" and I will be watching it again.",insideout
Inside Out is a good movie… for everyone. It is a very good definition of a family movie. I would say it is probably slightly more enjoyable for adults but is still a good movie for kids and will become an even better movie if they watch it when they are older.,insideout
"This is peak Pixar. The concept all in itself is already incredibly creative and the fact the movie has so much character and life in it, this is a film that is legitimately worth watching.",insideout
"Pixar yet again hit's one out of the park with this brilliant movie. A story that could of been difficult to tell to kids is done with sensitivity, heart and of course humour.",insideout
"I honestly believe this is one of Pixar's best and most heartfelt films, which is really saying something. A quibble, RT; why in several places do you say this film only made 2 million dollars? I don't get it. It made about 860 million worldwide, on a budget of 175. An unqualified success. How did a 2 million number ever appear?",insideout
A real tearjerker and such an original concept. I really don't know how they pulled it off. Even the world building in this movie is somehow really cool. It's a visual spectacle. Relatable characters and a great message.,insideout
"The wonder of bright colors and pastels can be summed up in one word: Beautiful! In every step of the way where we can feel happy and sad while watching this Disney juggernaut, and in my opinion, this movie is NOT only the best movie of the year, but this is also the best movie of the 21st century. And anyone can tell that this movie is original, tearjerking, beautiful, wonderful, funny, sincere, and very sweet. Most family movies don't operate that way anymore, and is on the level of ""The Prince of Egypt"" and ""The Iron Giant""",insideout
Inside out was amazing. It was very funny and good. I just didn't like all the things that were happening to Riley. Really good movie.,insideout
"An amazing and creative way to explain emotions to kids (or everyone), or for kids to learn about their inner selves. Very emotional scenes at the end. Family movie enjoyable for all age ranges.",insideout
This just an excellent movie that finds a way of explaining something as complicated as human emotions and does so simply for us to understand. It's a movie that so effectively captures the human expirence.,insideout
"A Gorgeously animated, immensely creative and marvelously written Pixar gem that from start till finish is an emotionally powerful journey that has top levels of charm, wit and human growth.",insideout
When I first looked that the cover of the movie I said to my self this is gonna be the worst movie I've ever seen but I watched it and it was better than I expected it to be,insideout
No puedo parar de emocionarme cada vez que una película me saca unas lágrimas. Es un sentimiento y una sensación muy bonita que todo ser vivo debería experimentar alguna vez en la vida.,insideout
"This movie literally made my whole childhood , the creativity and emotions I find in this movie are so amazing! I'd even like to pass this movie into further generations. The plot twist and story it hold is empowering. Riley represents half of teenagers these days which makes the movie comforting. Every time I dont feel like I pop my popcorn out and start watching 😂💕💕 . This is a masterpiece HONESTLY 5/5 . Definitely deserve watching",insideout

"Pixar's ""Inside Out"" is an original and emotionally gripping film that captivated audiences before its sequel. The movie offers a unique perspective by delving into the inner workings of a young girl's mind, personifying her emotions as characters. The relationship between Joy and Sadness is a central focus, as they embark on a journey together to not only comprehend each other but also to safeguard Riley from losing herself and her connections. The emotional rollercoaster they navigate, alongside Fear, Disgust, and Anger, provides a compelling exploration of the complexities of human emotions.

""Inside Out"" is a heartwarming and entertaining experience suitable for families and children alike. It encourages collective engagement and fosters an understanding that it is natural to experience a range of emotions. Ultimately, the film conveys a powerful message that resonates with viewers of all ages - that it is acceptable to feel a variety of emotions, including anger and fear. ""Inside Out"" is a delightful and touching cinematic masterpiece that showcases the universality of human feelings.",insideout
"All teenagers should see this film. For me, being a mature adult it wasn't quite as a 'wow' however it stayed with me for some days, especially how crucial it is to give sadness space within the mind.",insideout
cool concept but joy was insufferable character with too much self importance. Plot was mild as the movie is more focused on the concept and showing how the mind works. Bing bong's sacrifice was my highlight of the movie,insideout
"Archie’s review: “Yes, I liked it. The cats at the end were my favourite. I liked the start. I’m not really sure what happened. I liked the blue one, the sad one. The circle balls were memories. Don’t ever ask me about the train.” 🧠",insideout
"Its poignant and imaginative. It made me think of the comic strip The Numbskulls, where people live inside the persons head. I also thought that the headquarters resembled, in terms of size and space/imagination wise, the inside of the Tardis on Doctor Who!. The CGI is very good and I enjoyed the variety of different, somewhat hyperactive characters, not just the 5 main emotions but the imaginary friend, Bing Bong, who cries sweets (candy), among others. I enjoyed it - it is a little cheesy and rather sickly sweet at the end but its not too bad overall, for a kids film. Would I recommend it? Yes I would.",insideout
"Pixar is back! A great animated movie that can be read in different ways, without leaving out the fun and jokes for children who, when they grow up, will see the kind of movie that Inside Out is. This is what Pixar is by nature and I missed it so much.",insideout
Este filme é incrivel. fala sobre estabilidade emocional e como forçar a alegria é horrivel para o emocional das pessoas. A mente da Riley está organizada de forma criativa.,insideout
"This animated movie was great. Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Richard Kind, Mindy Kaling, and the rest of the cast did a great job on this movie. The story of the movie was entertaining and humorous. It's about a way to look inside the mind and how emotions control us. If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out sometime. It's a great movie for an entire family.",insideout
"Amazing movie. This movie takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions through the eyes of an 11-year old girl. It hits me so hard and got me so moved with those emotions, especially towards the end of the movie, that it really is a beautiful masterpiece of a film. This movie is really for all ages, and I'd strongly recommend you watch it if you haven't already. It is among my top Pixar movies of all time, and it deserves all the love it gets.",insideout
"I know a great deal of people adore this movie but for me at least I think it's one of pixar's worst endeavours, I found none of the characters interesting, the story ultimately flat and derivative and the only upsides are the decent animation and premise, if you enjoy it that's fine but it's one of the few pixar movies I wouldn't intend on watching again anytime soon.",insideout
"One of the best Pixar movie for kid and full of emotional. For the whole story of the movie it about person emotion example joy,angry,sad and fear that our emotions try to control our body and they thinking that their own action are best solving problem. The best point of the movie isn't about movie story but that is how Pixar communicate to watcher to talk about our human emotions, How to sit with our emotions in rate PG and totally this film is made for everyone one of the best film ever ENJOY.",insideout
"A film created both for children and adults, which approaches psychological concepts in an outstandingly creative and accessible manner. The Fantasy, Animation, Comedy, Kids & Family movie ‘Inside Out' (2015), directed by Pete Docter, finds an original way of depicting the processes our mind goes through during the times it is taken over by different emotions and memories. After freshly moving out with her family to San Francisco, 11-year-old protagonist Riley Andersen, whose mind is controlled by 5 basic emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger, is having a hard time getting accustomed to the new environment, thus longing for the old days and bringing back the bittersweet memories of her birthplace. This, however, means that the lead in the Brain Headquarters would be taken by Sadness, which is seen negatively by the other emotions, especially Joy, who took the leader role. In her attempt of getting Sadness to step back from the control panel, the both end up sucked out of the Headquarters, accompanying Riley's core memories, which they now have to find a way to restore, in order to keep Riley's personality, all while Anger, Fear, and Disgust are forced to take charge of Riley's life, with disastrous results. What I mostly liked about the movie was the writing, which was done very accurately to portray how emotions and memories help make us who we are. The team managed to illustrate Joy as the most complex emotion, envisioning her as vulnerable and intangible because she was ""unapologetically positive"". They had the idea about Joy's potential to excessively manipulate youth, creating Riley's ""social storms"", which is an excellent way of addressing toxic positivity. The key-message that is highlighted throughout the events in the film is that happiness implies feeling sadness as well. Loving someone intrinsically means feeling hurt when we lose them. We NEED sadness in our lives, in order to fully experience joy. We need to cope with painful situations from time to time, in order to grow and become better as a person. (""Crying Helps Me Slow Down And Obsess Over The Weight Of Life's Problems."" - Sadness) Another great aspect of the movie is its animation, particularly the character design. The team had been assigned a hard job of visualising and turning abstract concepts into understandable for kids animated characters. Not only have they given every character a unique colour and shape pattern (with Anger being shaped like a brick, Joy - a star, Sadness - a teardrop and Fear being tall and thin like a nerve), but they totally moulded each of the emotions from different textures, as well as even making their moves different, accordingly to their personalities (making Fear to be all floppy and dangling all the time and Anger to always keep his stiff, still posture). On top of that, they even went as far as making Joy glow from within, by creating a ""sparkly"" aura for her, which took a lot of time and efforts. All in all, I can admit that having watched the animation more than 3 times doesn't make rewatching it every time any less of a tear-jerker. It is hands down a brilliant production, put together for both children and their parents to enjoy. I absolutely recommend it for a family movie night, not only because it's a much simple way of teaching a child about how their mind works, but also because it's a great tool to help people of any age understand themselves more and learn how to figure out their emotions and besides, it offers some great insight into psychology and neuroscience in a highly uncomplicated way.",insideout
"WOW. This is definitely one of th best movies Pixar has made. Not only because of the amazing animation, but also the story and emotion (of course ;)) it carries. At one point (spoilers ahead!) where Riley returned home after trying to run away and fell in her parents' arms, I starting crying. Also, I watched the movie again recently (I am 16) and I kind of cried again at that scene. Amazing how they done it. Good job Absolute Must See!!!",insideout
Good idea but the story was stretched out unnecessarily with too many predictable ups and downs. Could have been edited to be a 1.5 hour movie.,insideout
"This movie is for babies, this may not be a fair rating though as every 20 times I have watched it...... I mean every 20 times I have slept through it. I still don't know how they manage to get back to the head office",insideout
"`Inside out` is probably one of the worst animation movie I have seen. It lacks a sense of character recognition, at times purpose and importantly emotional connect.",insideout
"The emotions of an eleven year-old girl named Riley are brought to life inside her head as they move from Minnesota to San Francisco. The voice casting in this film is amazing! Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are terrific as Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust respectively. Them and Richard Kind as Bing Bong drive this film. This film has so much thought put into it (pun intended)! The way they portray things like memory, abstract thought, dreams, depression, etc., is so creative and somewhat educational. The finale also brings a great emotional lesson for anyone. Not only is the story and backgrounds creative, but the animation and attention to detail is simply astounding and makes this film worth watching repeatedly. This movie is a must watch!",insideout
"Animation quality - top of the line, shallow a human to the role of a puppet of his emotions and addressing such a concept to children calls for vengeance to heaven",insideout
"Pixar has made movies of all kinds - What if toys had feelings, what if insects had feelings, what if monsters had feelings, what if cars had feelings, what if fishes had feelings, what if rats had feelings. And now they have made Inside Out - what if feelings had feelings? Inside Out is probably one of the most underrated movies that Pixar has made. It was the first original Pixar movie which I didn't get to know about when it released (the first such one was a sequel, Monsters University), and I'm really surprised how this movie gets overlooked so easily. The way I see it, this movie is a social commentary about how we perceive life with our emotions. Riley here is a metaphor of us, how we feel when we move to a new place and are unable to handle the new life. In such situations we either feel scared, angry or depressed. When Riley starts crying in class, Joy tries to stop Sadness from ruining her memory with a vacuum but ends up destroying all her other memories. This is another metaphor from our lives, where we end up forgetting all our happy memories in times of desperation. Later on Joy and Sadness are in her memories, where they see Riley's childhood drawing of Bing Bong whom she considered her friend. The plot has been made with a complete sense of nostalgia. When we feel nostalgic, we feel both happiness and sadness at the same time. We are happy because we got to live those times, the time which was better than what we are living at the moment. We are sad because we know that time never stops, and so everyday we are straying further away from when it happened. We will never be able to live the day again, and it shall only stay in our memory. While Joy and Sadness are not present Fear, Anger and Disgust control her. I don't think I need to explain this. Riley has lost all her happiness and does not feel any sadness. Keep in mind she had previously cried in class, which is something very embarrassing for a ten year old child. As a result she does not want to show her sorrow in front of everyone since she fears people will laugh at her, so instead she tries to cover it with anger and disgust. This is just like how we behave when we are depressed but are also too afraid of what others might think if they learn about it. And then there is the memory dump, the place where the old memories are forgotten. This is one of the deepest messages that the movie gave us. To save Joy and Sadness and allow them to get out of the pit, Bing Bong readily sacrifices himself. This is because he had always considered himself and Riley friends, and he was ready to sacrifice his own life for this. It also shows how Riley has now lost the memory of Bing Bong due to her depression and frustration, and it is something she will never remember again. This is a metaphor of how we forget the small details from our childhood which gave us joy once we grow out of the phase. It also symbolises that although Bing Bong has been lost forever, Riley's joy and sadness will always remember him. This is similar to how we get nostalgic whenever we see our childhood writings and drawings. And finally when Joy and Sadness do make it back, then Joy chooses to let Sadness guide Riley. If she wanted she could have guided Riley and make her feel happy about reuniting with her parents. But in that case the moment would have completely lost the impact. So instead Sadness did it, which is why Riley started crying, something she had not done for a long time. This is yet another metaphor of when we are unable to hold our sorrow for too long and burst out crying. As a result her parents are finally able to understand the situation she is in and give her more love. In the end Riley starts feeling happy, since everyone has understood the value of Joy. She was the first emotion that Riley felt, and the one who guided them all in the time of desperation. All the other emotions came to her afterwards, which is why they are not as emotionally attached to Riley as Joy does. Joy knows what is the best for her, just like how we feel the best thing for our life is what makes us happy.",insideout
This film was a massive achievement and gave Pixar's first Animated Feature win since Toy Story 3. One Of The Best Movies Of The 2010's.,insideout
"Summary: Five emotions—Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and Sadness—live in Riley's mind and help her navigate her pre-teen world. Having just moved from Minnesota to San Francisco, she has a lot of changes ahead! Takeaways: Incredible representation and teaching moment for children about our emotions.",insideout
"Just….how? How did Pixar make another flawless film after three films that I would either consider meh or bad? I just don't get it! Let's just make sure Pete Doctor directs every Pixar movie ever and we will be a-ok. I don't want to talk about all the good things with this movie, because let's face it: everyone has done that. Instead, I want to talk about all the things that this Pixar movie does better than all the others. First, I think this is the best voice cast for any Pixar movies prior or after this. The only one that kind of comes close for me is Toy Story 4, but that's for a different review. Biggest highlight is of course the great work of Amy Phoeler as Joy, it was just spot on. Next, comedy. Seeing how the main character is literally the concept of Joy, I would like to think that this movie was going to be funny. And I was right with this being, in my personal opinion, the funniest Pixar movie. Lewis Black as Anger is just a laughing riot to me. He was hilarious! Finally, how can you not talk about this movie without mentioning the ending, with two big emotional parts that really leave a huge impact. The first being the death of Bing Bong, which feels a little like it comes out of nowhere, but you're going to remember it. And, of course, when Riley comes home from running away and the parents also say that they miss the old home….OMG it's so good! The only kind of problem is that Anger is mainly the reason all the islands get destroyed, and no one addresses it at any moment. But that's minor, and no one is going to be thinking that in their first viewing, I only noticed it in my most previous viewing of the movie anyway. I really think someone should do a deeper dive into this movie, cause it really deserves it. However, I can only praise it for so long. Go to Disney+ and watch this flawless film and to see the best Pixar has to offer!",insideout
Inside Out is a fantastic movie. This movie is so original engaging and entertaining. I actually couldn't believe how smart this movie was. There's a lot of cleverness of how the mind works and how we feel. This movie is the definition of creativity. There are so many stories you could tell from this type of concept. The animation is phenomenal and the movie is drop dead has a solid script and has relatable characters beyond your wildest dreams. Inside Out is really just a a good movie and I have no other thing to say about it. 10/10,insideout
Inside Out is a great movie that I would definitely watch again! I really enjoy how each emotion was explored and the vibrant animation is as good as always!,insideout
"My kid laughed at me crying at this one. It's a wonderful guide to human psychology, and probably more for parents than kids. One socioeconomic critique? When Riley gets to San Francisco and the townhouse she enters is supposedly depressing and rodent infested, I couldn't see through my adult vision of: That's a multi-million dollar home in San Francisco, Riley...Your parents must work in the tech industry and you are RICH! Cheer up, that's no Charlie Bucket dwelling, you're practically Veruca Salt!",insideout
"100/100. Simply the best animation movie I have ever seen. When it comes to emotion, this movie hits all of the right chords. At its core, ‘Inside Out' is a movie about the personification of human emotions but it is laid out for viewers in such a charming and witty way, both adults and children can enjoy this Pixar film. Throughout the movie, you are taken on an emotional roller coaster that will make you tear up and then laugh in the same scene. Everybody can relate to this movie making it a must watch while also being Pixar's greatest movie ever released.",insideout
"From a few of the same key players that brought Up, Inside Out is another profoundly affective animated drama guaranteed to pry emotion from anyone with a heart. The voice cast and animation all seem to be up to Pixar standard, while the emotion alone makes the film. The story combines the gut-wrenching and the fun, but does require the switching off of brains. Every story needs some logic or rules, even within a fantasy, to really work and have genuine stakes, and this just doesn't. You're introduced to the system, but you receive the feeling that elements and abilities In the moment, the film does more than enough to be positively memorable and pack a top-tier emotional punch, and this alone makes it good despite its numerous problems.",insideout
The single greatest animated movie of all time. It's a beautifully animated film with deep themes and messaging that works well for adults and children. This is one of my all time favorite films that delivers a powerful message.,insideout
This is a very cute film that explains the depth of mood and the importance of being sad and also happy. It also explains depression and anger in a more child friendly way. The bright colours and beautiful imagery make for a nice watch Gives you a good representative and idea of what types of mood can make what kind of ripple affect. A good family film,insideout
Hits all the right points of growing up as a kid and keeps it fun and enjoyable. It is also one of the few films to actually make me emotional. Damn you bing bong,insideout
"A masterpiece in how it’s structured, how the world of the mind is built, and telling a story a lot of people can relate to, whether it be moving away or something else.",insideout
Of course not a complete view on feelings. But I mean we don't truly understand them yet anyways. So all there is to say is the movie just makes you think about yourself and others. And hopefully you'll evolve from doing so. I highly recommend it to everyone!,insideout
"Inside Out review A heartfelt animated movie, ""Inside Out"", takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions with creative imagination and a look back at some nostalgic moments we might have had in our childhood. Unlike any other, Pixar studios created an original movie of the emotions that go behind a person's mind and made them into having their own personalities.

With the presence of the emotion joy it shows her story of her two loving parents raising her and living the life with many moments that one child creates. Including the building of humor, friendship and playing your favorite sport. But as all children go through the other emotions such as sadness, fear ,disgust and anger it will include her experiences.

Her emotions will be put to the test in adapting to a new lifestyle they're typically unused to. To start off , it shows the beginning of the first years in Riley's life. Transitioning from stages to the preteens years of her life. This is where she experiences many emotions and personal likeness and dislikeness. Riley is seen on her journey as she experiences all typical childhood memories. From learning how to walk to talking your first new words. Discovering your least favorite meal to favorite toy to take with you everywhere. The laughter you create and the sad moments you experience. The rewarding moments of receiving a good grade to being upset for losing an important game. As Riley is growing she has experienced majority exciting emotions until a certain news comes to her attention. She will be moving from her childhood home Minnesota, where she was born, raised, and grew up to miles away into the city of San Francisco. Despite the change , her emotion Joy makes Riley see all this in a positive way. Meeting new friends, decorating a new room and many more ideas.

Adapting to the city and less outdoor activity is one of the unfortunate changes making her find new adventures. On her first day of school, she is introduced to her classmates and told to talk a bit more from her time back home. As she recalls some of her favorite memories, the emotion sadness touches her favorite memory, changing Riley's memory to a sad moment and turning it into a sorrowful memory. Joy continues to try and make Riley enjoy the new memories. After they had another similar disagreement Joy and Sadness cause the core memories to be knocked from their containers and accidentally vacuumed along with them into Riley's emotional interior. With this problem, it leaves the other emotions Fear, Disgust and Anger to run the emotions until the others return changing RIleys behavior. Throughout the film it shows the many obstacles and challenges Joy and Sadness must go through to reach the headquarters. Following with revisiting old memories and lifelong imaginary friends. It will take a spin through some future glimpse some being Riley's future boyfriend and many more. Overall this unfortunate event turned out to be a better lesson.

88%. 3/19/21. 2nd watch. A little sad and frustrating with the girl being so unhappy for a lot of it. But insanely creative and so clever with the aspects of the brain and personality they materialize into beings. Cool that it takes place in SF so the animation is sweet,insideout

"Normally, Almost every animation which are made by Disney and Pixar are interesting to most people because they mostly fun, happy to watch, beautiful graphic, etc. , but I think 'Inside out' is more than that. I have remembered that in the time this movie has been released, it was very famous. But I have not seen it yet until two months ago that I watched it. The first time I have seen this movie to the end. I understood to many media why they rated this animated movie very high. First It is about the graphic of the animation. As we have known. Disney and Pixar are one of the best animation studios about graphic, and they have done to this movie very well, such as an appearance of a character. There are lots of details about graphic, sharpness of the video, etc. Second, sound effect. In my opinion. Sound effect are very important to every movie in the scenes that want to show, or express more the feeling to the audiences than only the movie scene. And this movie expresses the feeling to the audiences very well such as happy, sad, scared. The last thing and it is the most interesting point is about feeling. It is what this movie expresses to us. For me, this part is the point that makes this movie different to other animation movies that Disney and Pixar have made. It is more than a movie for entertaining. It teaches us how we can control our feeling , however I will not tell you what feeling that I mean. I want you find it by yourself in the movie. Then after you watch it, you will understand what I have told to you. But there is one inferior point in this movie. It is distribution of the character. Some characters are very notable, but there are few characters have a few of air time, scenes that they act. In my opinion, 'Inside out' is still one of my best animation movie. For me, I give it 1/3 of the best Disney and Pixar movie of all time. If anyone is looking for some full of quality movie. 'Inside out' is the great choice. concluding, very well work for Disney and Pixar making this movie. I give 9 out of 10. I hope you enjoy my review more or less. Thank you so much!",insideout
"I think this was a good movie. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that how Riley was going to run away. I didn't really like that part very much. But over all, it was a good movie.",insideout
"It's really awesome and it hit us with the feelings at the end T_T (I'm not going to spoil it but I recommend a tissue) The character designs were great and I liked the sharp idea with it. Didn't disappoint me at all. I also loved the parts where they zoom into other people's minds and see their emotions. It was humorous and funny - ""Oh my god, that is not brightly colored or shaped like a dinosaur - OH NO IT'S BROCCOLI!"" Overall I recommend the movie.",insideout
"I RANK IT 4 AND A HALF BECAUSE IT WASN'T MY FAVORITE FILM BY PIXAR, UP HIT ME MORE, OK FINE INSIDE OUT HIT ME MORE, BUT I LIKED CORALINE (NOT REALLY A PIXAR FILM) YES YES AND CORALINE IS MADE MY LAKIA I THINK.",insideout
I love this movie! One of the best movies everrrr. I have watched this over and over again and never get bored of it. The emotions are great characters and the angry man is by far my favorite cartoon out here. He is me to the core. lol. I love this move and recommend it to anyone,insideout
"De longe, o melhor filme da Pixar. Tanto a proposta como a execução são excelentes, os dramas e temas são bem trabalhados, as personagens são carismáticas e a produção é ótima, assim como em todo filme do estúdio.",insideout
One of these smart adult cartoons. Enjoyable for the whole family they say but probably more enjoyable for the parents would be my guess. Very easy viewing.,insideout
"Pretty fantastic. The specific look of the characters ran from the familiar (humans, Bing Bong) to the unique, fresh. Colors are extreme, but in a good way. This is comedy, but it's not all just a light-hearted ride. And it's the heavier elements of the story that make this such a fully-realized take on the base concepts here. Riley moves with her family half way across the country, to a place far different from her Minnesota hometown; too different, it would seem. Stellar work by the voice-over cast. Poehler is always great. Smart choice in casting Smith as Sadness. She knows her way around some sad, as she clearly showed on The Office. Kind was a great Bing Bong. Kaling was all over Disgust. And Hader was....well...Hader; which means brilliant and funny and just unbeatable. The movie does tread a bit close to overly sweet at moments, but it never gets too saccharine, sentimental or dark. There's a wonderful balance between the emotions that show the very real feelings of a kid going through such changes. Overt sweetness that is typical in kids animation is sorta replaced with nostalgia; a common but strong emotion. But along with the fantastical, the eye candy visuals, the depth and cleverness of the screenplay, they always remember to bring the funny. 4 stars",insideout
"What a beautiful and powerful movie! The message is so important and can help all ages. A brilliant screenplay very original! The animation and concepts this movie creates were so fun and genius. They made sadness ( the character) annoying at the start of the movie, which was intentional a very cool choice, a very good character arc. The score by Michael Giacchino is perfect. Pete Docter and his team have done another brilliant movie, for everyone to enjoy and learn from.",insideout
"I found this to be second only to Toy Story 3 in the strength of its pull on my emotions. I'm glad that I was already a parent when I saw the movie & wasn't a kid going into it with a blind faith in all things Pixar as it does seem like at least portions of the storyline would be difficult to follow, but watching it in my mid-20s it's clear that this was a film created by and, really, for parents. The score was awesome & the voice acting was among the best that I've ever seen as the casting choices were absolutely impeccable. I found the pixellated aura around Joy & the others to be rather distracting but mostly because it seemed like the rest of the film was very finely animated & ended up with an internal debate over whether they were supposed to seem like they were fading away or not; also, knowing that hair is among the hardest things to animate, I found Joy's immobile hair a bit lacking in nuance. The personality islands stretched my suspension of disbelief a bit & I can imagine retrospectively them going a different direction with the screenplay in the form of the emotions conquering some sort of antagonist made up of the outburst Riley seemed destined for over the move, but I digress. The movie was still very good viewing material exactly how it was. Kudos!",insideout
"This had a great concept, but was executed horribly, in my opinion this is Pixar at its worst, the moral of the story felt like this it’s ok to make poor decisions as long as you feel sad about it later.",insideout
"Inside Out delivers a though-provoking message and a timeless coming-of-age story told brilliantly through the perspective of personified emotions. While the concept of the inner workings of the human mind have been done before and after this film, none come close to topping Inside Out's brilliant writing and world-building.",insideout
"Hard to criticise such a creative, clever and funny movie! It didn't emotionally connect with me like other Pete Docter films (Up, Soul etc.) but doesn't mean it's not a tremendously clever and special film.",insideout
"A beautifully animated, well considered examination of the experiences, emotions and thought processes we go through when coming-of-age. It's clever, funny, and emotive, giving something the whole family can enjoy",insideout
"Inside Out is an amazing movie about all the emotions of a girl named Riley. It is pretty sad at times, but it also is very uplifting and happy. A good movie for all ages.",insideout
"It shows Riley emotions really well. And Sadness role in core memory before it turned to Joy also portraited very well. I'm a little bit sad for Bing Bong but that's life. Overall, worth it",insideout
"Inside Out is good movie but needs a lot of work story wise. Everything felt so messy and out of place. Right off the bat it felt like were placed in a scene that were supposed to know what was happening, but didn't. Everyone was attacking Sadness in the first 5 minutes which seemed like a bad way to start the movie. The rest of the movie is decent with dialogue being sometimes funny and the pacing being fine. The animation is also good. There is really nothing amazing in this movie. It is a decent movie that I think needed more time to figure itself out.",insideout
"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend. This is a wonderfully little story of world building and exploration of the human mind through a young teen girl who is scare of the huge amount of change happening in her life. The parallel of internal struggle and outward reaction to adversity really sets this movie apart. The audience is literally taken on a exploration of the mind, and the story is not only fun, but capable of serious philosophical concepts. Because it exemplifies ""show, don't tell"" those conversations are compacted into palatable actions by the characters. This is a movie that might make you laugh, cry or both. It's hard to believe that someone wouldn't relate to this somehow, and probably more that they wouldn't enjoy it at all.",insideout
"I'm not really into the Pixar movies and this definitely explains why. The storyline was too weird for me. If this movie had been around when I was a kid, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more. As an adult, I did not.",insideout
"Inside Out is perhaps the most original work by Pixar. It touched me and spoke to me so much that it instantly became my favourite Pixar movie. It's quite rare that I cry during a movie. This movie is both happy and sad at the same time. The plot is so genious and deep, and the theme is relatable. Easily a masterpiece for me.",insideout
"The movie has a very interesting premise but is not funny enough to keep me entertained. It took a lot to be engaged and while it was good to kind of imagine personalities, emotions and memories in this spectacular simplified system, the movie left a lot to be desired.",insideout
"This is so much more than just a kids movie - its message and themes will resonate more with adults. It touches on human emotion, change, coming-of-age, and family. It's a bold, heartfelt, and gorgeously-animated film with a fantastically unique premise and well-fleshed out and emotional (get it?) characters. The voice cast is superb and fit their respective characters perfectly.",insideout
It's a good movie but as far as Pixar movies go I'd say it's average should have won the oscars it was up against a movie which is objectively much better my life as a zucchini was a 10/10 movie this was a solid 6/10,insideout
Inside Out Is one of my favorite Pixar movie and animated movie with Amy Poehler and Bill Hader. It shows its ok to be 😢 its ok to be 😡 its ok to not be 😃 all the time. 10/10 great movie see it,insideout
"Inside Out is a very fun movie for all ages, it has its funny, emotional, and fun scenes, but I'm more impressed about the character development, it's amazing! They made all the characters so likeable and relatable (I'm looking at disgust) and overall a perfect movie, 5 stars",insideout
The titel of the film gives a slight hint at how beautifully animated the movie is. I must say that the voice performances and script were well crafted around fun filled characters that make this film watchable for its well suited run time. Would really recommend the film to almost anyone who loves a good Pixar film.,insideout
"An affectionate commentary on psychological problems, mental health and family relationships. A modern classic from Pixar, an imaginative idea that is executed in a truly original way. With a talented voice cast, endearing characters, a poignant script, gorgeous and colorful visuals, and an entertaining and emotionally rewarding narrative, it'll surely leave a lasting impact on audiences of all ages.",insideout
"I can’t say I’m much of a fan. But pretty animation is the only thing saving this film from a zero star rating. With a lot of emotion and feeling, ‘Inside Out’ feels...bleh!",insideout
"Inside Out, originated by Pete Docter & Ronnie del Carmen, put out the most unique & fresh story premise since Toy Story in 1995! With Docter directing, del Carmen screenwriting, & Andrew Stanton & John Lasseter producing, they brought back the Pixar hype, coming off the mediocre titles in Brave, Monsters University & The Good Dinosaur. The concept is very creative & original, with a very clever narrative. The story was very well paced, touching up on real world problems, hitting many emotional notes. For a children's film, it is very mature, while still having great family fun. For a fictional tale, this film really made you think after the movie; I'd be lying if I said I never thought about this in my head. The characters were just a blast of fun, with everyone having their own definitive personalities, of course. Our master child if you will, had great real life problems. Her character really reflects on what it's like at that age, and what your emotions feel at most times. If Pete Docter & Ronnie del Carmen wanted to get real crazy, they could've added emotions like, love, loyalty, caring, etc, but they would've had to re-write the whole narrative for that to work. I got myself so invested into Sadness, that I built this real-life hate for her. The screenplay by Ronnie del Carmen, Josh Cooley & Meg LeFauve had plenty of solid laughs, incorporating deep dialogues, speaking about mature, real world issues. It truly goes without say, the cinematography & animations are just as close to flawless as it gets. Everything had amazing detail, being either vibrant or dull while showing great texture. The production designer in Ralph Eggleston created this outside the box world, incorporating terrific set pieces. Overall, I didn't really find to much wrong with this film, other than it being a little slower at times, and it kind of copied that Toy Story feel a little; nevertheless very solid Pixar film, to show that they're back in action, while winning an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.",insideout

"This is one of the more emotional pixar films. The characters and their designs are all great. What holds this movie back, is the fact that it has a lot of plot holes. Why don't they send the core memories back to the station, with the machine they used to send up the gum ad? Why did they have to wake up Riley? They themselves said, that nothing bad could happen to her, while she is asleep. Just wait on the train. But besides these valid and undeniable mistakes, this movie is really rich in emotions, funny jokes, great characters and a decent story.",insideout
"A wildly creative, brightly animated, hilarious, & moving adventure. Personifying emotions creates many unique aspects, especially the theme that sadness is natural & needed for growing up. Using colors for visual storytelling is genius.",insideout
Please every child should watch this at some point in their lives. It is just the best cartoon I've ever seen. It tells an interesting and meaningful story about the transformations and challenges met by Riley throughout the course of her growth. Beautiful animation.,insideout
"I got low expectations, but came out with a big smile on my face, tears in my eyes and turns out that this is my favorite Pixar movie, absolutely loved it. INSIDE OUT 10.0",insideout
"This movie is a good laugh. The movie is about a girl going through a hard family time while becoming a teenager, so all her emotions are thrown off balance. The kids may enjoy this one for its laughs, but I feel as if the adults will have more fun watching it. Pixar playing with our emotions with a movie based on emotions. It is brilliant when you think about it.",insideout
"É um filme de grande sutileza, retrata de questões da vida de forma leve e divertida. Ótimo para crianças e adultos. Acredito que funciona mais para adultos, pelo seu tema complexo, pela produção obscura na maior parte do tempo e qualidade do roteiro. Gostei muito.",insideout
"This is why I love Pixar. Inside Out is the best Pixar movie to come out this decade and their second best overall. It's just near perfect. It has such an incredibly creative premise with so many great ideas. The creative team put so much effort into it. The animation is so beautiful and detailed, the score is pretty incredible and emotional, the voice acting is terrific, it's hilarious and I just love the characters and message this movie gives. I think kids and adults can both relate to it. And it's so sad! It's probably the saddest Pixar movie but that's a good thing. I just adore this movie!",insideout
"Brilliantly inventive and astonishingly nimble on its feet. At the same time, it lacks the fun of The Incredibles, the emotion of Wall-e and the fun AND emotion of all the Toy Story films. It's a must see, just for its imagination, but I don't think it will stir many heart strings",insideout
"I'm not a fan of animated movies but, this movie is really good, it is better than all animated movies I seen in my entire life",insideout
"Inside Out is a heartwarming, enjoyable and downright excellent film. The message about it's OK to not always feel happy is great and the climax with this message in mind is really heartfelt, The movie is incredibly creative with dreams being made in a movie studio and the train of though being a literal train along with many more examples. The supporting emotions are hilarious and, although they feel a bit unlikable when Riley is running away, they provide for some of the funniest moments (which is saying something because the film is also hilarious). It is one of Pixar best films in a catalogue of many incredible ones.",insideout
"I have this movie on dvd, and frankly, this picture was certainly a creative way of looking at emotions. Plus, I love how the emotions were so dedicated to making sure that Riley had the best of everything, especially Joy.",insideout
"Pixar is a great movie maker! Although the plot was not that interesting for me at the beginning, I actually feel comfortable watching it again and again.",insideout
"Inside Out is one of Pixar's best. The humour was great, the concept was original and fresh, and the animation was as beautiful as ever. The voice acting was excellent, the plot was well paced, and the soundtrack was pleasant. Definitely worth a watch.",insideout
"Loved this film because it was fantastic, imaginative, funny, and sad. All the emotions where so good my favourite was Sadness she was hilarious and so cute!",insideout
"Inside Out is Pixar animation of the absolute highest order; it's concept (emotions are people) is genius, the execution of the plot is so, so clever, it is often hilarious, but more often tear-jerking, and these elements all combine to give us an utterly fantastic and explosive film that has all the tools necessary to go deeper, and give us basic but true insights on the nature of emotions and depression.",insideout
"Yeesh, this movie is actually far deeper than I was expecting it to be. Was not expecting this many {feels}. (Get it?) Really great movie for kids and adults. An instant Disney classic. 4/5.",insideout
"Inside Out always tries something new, even if it doesn't always work. The world inside Riley's head is extremely fun and creative, and there's other redeeming qualities like emotional moments, clever writing, and great jokes.",insideout
"Not only does this movie have such a great concept, but an inspiring message that applies to people of all ages. Mainly, why all of our emotions are important.",insideout
"A brilliant and beautiful story that touches upon one of the most important subjects in emotions, combined with the direction, screenplay, vocal performances, score, cinematography, editing, emotional weight and animation, Inside Out touches upon an all-important subject in the most moving way!!!",insideout
"This movie made me cry. I am not kidding. Watery tears came rolling down my cheeks. I really like the movie, it's one of my favorite movies in general. It hits. To anyone really, with similar feelings or experiences. It's broken down not in a, ""for kids only"" type of way, but more in a ""for everyone"". Not too deep nor not too light. I didn't expect to cry because of this movie. I'm glad I watched this. I recommend this to anyone. 10/10.",insideout
"I don't intend to go against the grain, but I truly disliked this movie. I think it was the sparkly animations of the inside. The outside world looks very nice but the inside animations of the person just seemed too bright! I know that's weird to base a review off of that but it just hurt my eyes.",insideout
"a great movie, it makes me think up imaginary stories of me with the emotions in my head, though it is kind of hard to think of how all the bad things happening at the exact worst time possible.",insideout
"The question of whether an animated film ostensibly made for an audience of children can gain legitimacy on the level of a dramatic film made for an audience of adults was essentially answered by this film which was a resounding critical and commercial success. It is heartwarming without pushing emotional responses on the audience and provides children and adults with an important message about the nature of our emotions and the need to balance them. Like most Pixar films it has the added benefit of looking great and featuring voice performances from famous movie stars who would actually seem to be trying. Any parent looking to entertain their child for an hour and a half could do much worse than this lovely film that blended mass appeal with deeply personal touches. What really helps the film is that the emotional arc that our apparently perfect main character Joy, Amy Poehler, goes on is effective and ends in a climax that makes her entire journey feel necessary. The realization that experiencing the highs and the lows is important so we can appreciate how special it is to be happy and learn from moments in which we felt sad. Our feelings mirror Joy's feelings as Sadness,, does come across as incredibly annoying at the beginning of the film but we come to realize that she is necessary by the end of the film and her acceptance is a nice moment. She is in many ways like the outcast kid who is slightly less boisterous and extroverted than her schoolmates and surely children will be able to identify with both Joy and Sadness as they realize they each play crucial roles. This is true of anything in life as whether you are running a company or simply being part of your family you are one cog in a larger machine that needs several different people to make it work. Joy and Sadness make each other better and work together for a common goal instead of knocking each other down due to their different ideas and completely destroying the life of the human they work for. These are the sort of selfless and giving figures that young women and men should model themselves on and Pixar should be applauded for making a film that is truly family friendly.",insideout
"Inside Out is an animated children's movie produced by Pixar and teaches kids about their emotions and how to use/control them in different situations. It is an amazing film filled with joy, sadness, anger, fear and digust which keeps you entertained from beginning to end.",insideout
"I fail words to describe the beauty of cinema that is 'Inside Out'. Pixar hasn't just created a visual, modern achievement but also a surreal, extremely dreamy and authentic story of coming-of-age has been translated to the screen. The 3D effect amazed me and the emotional conscience brought tears to my eyes. In other words, 'Inside Out' is not just a film, it's a joy. It's a total thing.",insideout
"A fantastic adventure from start to finish, and a very creative way of displaying emotions in what is a deserving winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.",insideout
"Fun movie! Amazingly original designs that fully convey the workings of the mind while making it accessible to all audiences, delivering an amazing story without being too heavy handed.",insideout
"I’m watching this today (23/10/25) for the first time, it’s never really appealed to me before! Won’t watch again, I’m glad I finally watched and realised FOMO isn’t a good thing!",interstellar
this is a rewatch but still a stunning and well-paced movie. i had to turn on cc for matthew mcconaughey though bc i could not catch what dude was saying half the time,interstellar
"Pure cinema. Interstellar is breath-taking, emotional, raw, combining realism with fiction, it is one, if not the best sci-i movie i have watched in my entire life. Interstellar is a genius cinema masterpiece, making you glued to the screen every second. Friendship, fatherhood, betrayal, love. If you’re a fan of space and science, or even movies in general, Interstellar is the best pick you can make. 2 hours and 40 minutes of pure cinema.",interstellar
"I have never understood why such a good movie was given a 73% rotten tomatoes. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, blending mind-boggling science that makes you think about the movie (if you have the will to do so) while blending love and persistence. I could not have asked for a better movie. Thank you so much Christopher Nolan.",interstellar
"You dare You dare say anything negative about the absolute best movie I have ever seen in my life and the best you will ever see The music, the scenes, the story The scene when he watches his children's messages after coming the edge of the Gargantua I watched the movie 3 times and j always cry in it And the docking scene💀 Man this is the absolute cenima experience This is the best movie I have ever watched in my life Better than inception Better than dark knight",interstellar
Even after a decade my love for this movie is unexplainable. Mind bending visuals and background score. Sentimental. Perfect casting. Nail biting scenes. Excellent screenplay. Best space related sci-fi movie of the decade. Watched a lot of times. Will watch too.,interstellar
Absolutely gorgeous movie! Every shot was beautiful and the story wasn’t bad but the ending blew my mind! There were some parts of the movie that felt like the story wasn’t going very slowly so that brings the score down.,interstellar
"EPIC SCIENCE FICTION: THE FILM STANDS OUT FOR FASCINATINGLY INTERTWINING REAL LIFE SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS SUCH AS TIME DILATION AND BLACK HOLES, WITH AN EPIC NARRATIVE OF SURVIVAL AND SPACE EXPLORATION. VISUAL AND SOUND EXPERIENCE: THE COMBINATION OF STUNNING VISUAL EFFECTS AND HANS ZIMER´S POWERFUL SOUNDTRACK CREATES AN IMMERSIVE AND MOVING ATHMOSPHERE THAT TRANSPORTS THE VIEWER THROUGH SPACE AND HUMAN EMOTIONS",interstellar
"Rarely does a film challenge the mind and stir the heart quite like Interstellar. Christopher Nolan creates a monumental cinematic experience, balancing high-concept scientific theories with a profoundly human story about love, loss, and sacrifice. Matthew McConaughey delivers a stellar performance as Cooper, a man torn between his family and his mission to save humanity.",interstellar
"Emotionally engaging, sci-fi yet grounded in its characters' motivations. A story revolving around science fiction yet ending on the note of 'it's love, it's about love' in its deeper forms, not just the oversimplified romantic one. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 for me? The ending. The whole point of the movie, Cooper's motivation for the entire mission...and so abruptly he lets it go? It undercuts the emotional payoff.",interstellar
"This movie was a masterpiece, with a jaw dropping plot, breath-taking cinematics, and an amazing storyline overall, there is almost nothing to hate about this movie. Although, I would say this movie is really long, and some people either love it or hate it... no in-betweens.",interstellar
"My absolutely favorite movie of all time! McConaughey is brilliant, and it becomes some much more realistic if you read “The Science of Interstellar” by Kip Thorne. Just absolutely brilliant. Recommend to everyone.",interstellar
Watched tonight at home. It was definitely great but maybe lacked just a little bit to get me to 5 star. There was several things that lost me. Could be a 5 star on a 2nd watch.,interstellar
"After a dodgy start with some exceedingly clunky & exposition-heavy dialog, it's fantastic once humanity's last hope gets into space. The effects are flawless & the story is as thought-provoking as it gets for a major movie. An excellent ending completes the brilliance & for me, this is what movie-making is all about when it's at its best.",interstellar
"The science may be spot on (or so I have been told) but the screenplay misses its mark by a mile. When viewed on the big screen the incredibly impressive visuals carry the film (stirring memories of seeing “2001” for the first time). When viewed years later on my screen at home you are all too aware of a script that is primarily exposition, melodrama and implausible contrivances and coincidences.",interstellar
It is still the best movie ever made. Being able to see my favorite movie on the big screen again was such a treat. It just hits different and is a movie that formats so well to a theater screen.,interstellar
A must see. Speechless. Mind opening. Truly a great movie that mixes a lot of different educations while also making it heart wrenching but spontaneously beautiful. 10/10,interstellar
"If you like drama or science fiction, you will absolutely FALL IN LOVE with this movie. I usually hate dramas because they are so cringy but Christopher Nolan always makes the best dramas. Masterpiece of a movie and anyone who thinks otherwise must just hate cinema altogether.",interstellar
"Ladies and gentlemen, today I stand before you not to praise a film, but to celebrate a monument. Interstellar is not merely a movie — it is a cathedral of cinema, a towering symphony of sight, sound, and soul. Christopher Nolan did not just direct; he summoned an experience that transcends the screen. The visuals are not special effects, they are visions of infinity itself. The score is not music, it is the heartbeat of the cosmos, shaking us to our very core with every organ note Hans Zimmer unleashes. This is a film that dares to wrestle with the largest questions humanity has ever faced: time, gravity, love, destiny. And it does not whisper — it roars. It drags us into the black hole of despair and hurls us back out into the blinding supernova of hope. At its core, Interstellar is not about space — it is about us. About the fire that keeps humanity alive, about the unbreakable threads of love that outlast galaxies, about the courage to leave the known and step into eternity. Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper is not just a character — he is every parent, every dreamer, every soul that has ever dared to hope for tomorrow. Other films entertain. Interstellar enlightens. Other films tell stories. Interstellar forges myths that feel eternal. Other films end when the credits roll. Interstellar lingers in your bones, in your breath, in your very blood. This movie is not the best of its decade. It is not the best of its century. It is the best ever — because it reminds us of the most essential truth: we are small, yes, but our love, our courage, our will to survive, make us infinite. So when we speak of cinema at its peak, let us not hesitate, let us not falter. The answer is clear, the answer is certain, the answer is eternal: Interstellar is the greatest film ever crafted by human hands. Thank you.",interstellar
"I am a fan of science fiction, not so much a fan of dramas. But this time, the drama part actually made the movie really shine. And the audio was spot-on, tied it all together perfectly.",interstellar
"first english, below spanish: english: the peak of science fiction. christopher nolan signed with 'interstellar' what is, without a doubt, his most ambitious and accomplished work. what unfolds here is a narrative and visual spectacle of unprecedented proportions, where every element aligns with surgical precision to construct an instant classic of modern cinema. the staging reaches heights of grandeur rarely seen in science fiction: settings of overwhelming beauty, visual effects that verge on technical perfection, and cinematography that turns every sequence into a sensory experience. but what is truly admirable is that this monumental scope never loses sight of emotion; the film beats with an intimate and deeply human force that transcends the merely spectacular. the screenplay, with impeccable structure and surprising clarity for the complexity of its themes, stands as one of the most solid and daring works of the last decade. the dialogues, carefully crafted, feel organic, filled with an intensity that deeply resonates with the viewer. the performances, astonishingly natural, reinforce this effect to the point of blurring the line between actor and character. the music by hans zimmer deserves special mention: possibly one of the most powerful scores ever composed. its ability to heighten tension, tear at emotion, and infuse each moment with transcendence makes it an autonomous experience, capable of sending shivers down the spine on its own. with a sustained rhythm that defies its long duration and a finale of overwhelming power, 'interstellar' is not just a space film, it is a cinematic milestone. a turning point in science fiction, rising deservedly to the olympus of contemporary film art. spanish: la cumbre de la ciencia ficción. christopher nolan firmó con 'interstellar' la que, sin lugar a dudas, es su obra más ambiciosa y lograda. lo que aquí se despliega es un espectáculo narrativo y visual de proporciones insólitas, donde cada elemento se alinea con precisión quirúrgica para construir un clásico instantáneo del cine moderno. la puesta en escena alcanza cotas de grandeza pocas veces vistas en la ciencia ficción: escenarios de una belleza sobrecogedora, efectos visuales que rozan la perfección técnica y una fotografía que convierte cada secuencia en una experiencia sensorial. pero lo verdaderamente admirable es que esta monumentalidad nunca pierde de vista la emoción; la película late con una fuerza íntima y profundamente humana que trasciende lo meramente espectacular. el guion, de impecable estructura y sorprendente claridad para la complejidad de sus temas, se erige como uno de los trabajos más sólidos y arriesgados de la última década. los diálogos, cuidadosamente elaborados, se sienten orgánicos, cargados de una intensidad que cala en el espectador. las interpretaciones, de una naturalidad apabullante, refuerzan este efecto hasta el punto de volver difusa la frontera entre actor y personaje. la música de hans zimmer merece mención aparte: posiblemente una de las bandas sonoras más poderosas jamás compuestas. su capacidad para elevar la tensión, desgarrar la emoción y dotar de trascendencia cada instante convierte a la partitura en una experiencia autónoma, capaz de erizar la piel por sí sola. con un ritmo sostenido que desafía su larga duración y un desenlace de potencia demoledora, 'interstellar' no es solo una película espacial, es un hito cinematográfico. un punto y aparte en la ciencia ficción, que se eleva con justicia al olimpo del séptimo arte contemporáneo.",interstellar
"i watched this movie recently and i truly regret not watching on a 3 Imax screen. it is honestly one of the best movie i've ever seen. the characters are great, everyone has their motive as to why they are the way they are. the cinematography is out of this world, it really shows how beautiful the universe is and christopher nolan makes a black hole which should be scary into this beautiful object our universe produced. the sound track is stellar, it's amazing and hans zimmer does it again with it beautiful piano and composing. the movie is a whole study about humanity and our universe, for someone who isn't familiar with science, this movie makes us explore, curious and research about bits of our existence. a truly amazing experience and movie",interstellar
"A timeless, mind-bending and visually transcendent cosmic odyssey about space, time and love, defined by astonishing performances and Hans Zimmer’s iconic score. Since watching it for the first time in 2014, I’ve made it a tradition to rewatch it at least once a year to remind myself of the true definition of a masterpiece.",interstellar
It is one of the few films in which the fear of the future is constant; its blend of scientific essence and what we would so far define as ‘fantasy’ intertwine to create a great cinematic arc.,interstellar
"Initially, I didn't think I'd watch this more than once, but over time it has grown on me. Not the best of it's kind, but it is worth at least one watch for sure!",interstellar
"One of the best films I've ever seen. I must have watched it ten times. Full of subliminal messages, the perfect integration of science and fiction. Perfect cast and performances. I intend to watch it again.",interstellar
"Interstellar is my favorite film. Nolan is a master like few others, and as a father of two girls, this film connected with me emotionally. I love this film, its soundtrack (Hans Zimmer never disappoints), its rhythm, its art. Don't miss it if you haven't already.",interstellar
"Christopher Nolan complicates matters in a very entertaining way as Matthew McConaughey and Crew venture across space and time and test the resolve of humankind in an attempt to save planet Earth. Meanwhile, Michael Caine displays his genius at acting back home. It’s understandable that the complications in the movie could cause an audience to wane slightly in interest, but the story remains gripping, and the action is turbulent and riveting in every good way.",interstellar
"Horrible movie waste of 3 hrs do not watch, bunch of space dorks competing for who can out dork the other dork. Makes absolutely 0 sense very hard to follow did not have one emotion run through my body while watching and was utterly bored. The fact this has such high reviews shows me how many super dorks are out in the world.",interstellar
"I watched ""Interstellar"" and it's a MASTERPIECE This movie is not boring, interesting, it has a great plot and it is also just great filmed christopher nolan did a great job. This movie may not be for everyone because to understand it you need to think. My rating for this movie is 10/10",interstellar
"What sets this apart from all the other Sci-Fi slop that floats about contemprorary media was how real it felt, nothing about the emotion conveyed in this move was fiction, it's message, it's story and acting all felt real and the lack of the heavy CGI made added to how well the movie looked and felt.",interstellar
"Una de mis películas favorita, esta película me dejó impactado con todos los efectos visuales que agregaron, y su historia es perfecta. Esto se merece una secuela si se pudiese.",interstellar
"I don't know how else to put it, this film genuinely changed my life. I have never seen things the same since I watched it, and it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've found that a lot of science fiction goes too far, but this one makes us think about time, space and what it means to be human while still holding onto a sense of reality. In my personal opinion, the best part about it was the comment on mortality, sacrifice and human connection-- and don't even get me started on the score! I still can't listen to it without being moved to tears. I know some people thought it was ""too sad"" or far fetched but I think it was really well done.",interstellar
"Such a Magnum Opus for both Hans Zimmer and Christopher Nolan. The movie has such a chilling and urgent feel the whole way through... it just feels like you're watching something important and beyond your understanding. I've seen it a good 6+ times now, including in IMAX for the re-release, and the 23 years of messages scene still makes me cry every time. I'll also never forget how absolutely captivated I was when the wormhole first appeared on screen, only to be even more so when we got our close-ups of Gargantua. The movie is so good that sometimes you forget that even the small details are captivating... take the fact that TARS and CASE are both equally likeable and funny but fit so seamlessly into the story that you don't even consider how impressive that is for a 3-piece robot with a voice. I think most of the (few) bad ratings come down to a lack of understanding of the science that went into this film. It's theoretically possible the entire way through which makes it even more mind-bending. If you haven't seen this, watch it with the volume up and with a box of tissues nearby. My favorite movie of all time by a long shot.",interstellar
"A movie so carefully thought out with so much emotion. Although the ending may have confused some people, I think that the rest of the movie makes up for the ending. A pleasant surprise.",interstellar
"I fear this movie did not live up to the exact height it was set at. That being said, its a good film. Not something I will think too hardly about when I go to bed at night but not something I regret watching. Matthew McConaughey really made the film what it is, outstanding job! I wish we saw more of the emotional impact of missing all these years, I felt this was brushed over too quickly.",interstellar
"Interstellar is a breathtaking masterpiece—visually stunning, emotionally powerful, and thought-provoking. Nolan delivers an unforgettable story about love, sacrifice, and the survival of humanity. My favorite movie of all time.",interstellar
"This is the best science fiction film ever created in the film industry. It fascinated me with the study of stellar and supermassive black holes and other areas of modern physics. The story may start off a bit timid, but I guarantee it builds to some truly engaging, exciting, and surprising moments. The film's soundtrack is impeccable, and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne's help with the script and post-production of the visual effects will take the audience's breath away.",interstellar
"Interstellar isn't a movie that you forget. It is strikingly beautiful, fantastically immersive, and tells a masterpiece of a story. This movie is by far my favorite of all time.",interstellar
"This is, without a doubt, the greatest movie I have ever seen. I recommend it to everyone. Even if you aren't into astronomy, this movie will rope you in and take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. Some of the greatest acting and cinematography out there. Nolan is a mastermind and McConaughey played his role perfectly.",interstellar
"My favourite movie of all time. It’s so good. The music, the story, the visuals. It may get critiqued for not being totally accurate to real physics, but it’s ok. That’s not a problem at all for someone like me who just enjoys the movie for the movie",interstellar
"The greatest movie of all time in my opinion it has everything you could want in a movie , thrill , story. Sadness , redemption, so darn great watched it 12 times",interstellar
"Interstellar is not simply about space. It is about love stretched thin across light years, about time slipping through fingers like dust, and about the quiet ache of what we leave behind. The science holds together better than most. There are liberties, but the film never feels careless. It truly invites the viewer to wonder, rather than simply to watch. What stays with me is not the theory but the feeling. As a father, I find the bond between Cooper and Murph almost too much to bear. The silence of years, the helpless distance, the hope left behind like a message in a bottle is difficult to forget. The music is absolutely remarkable. Zimmer’s score does not merely accompany the film; it gives indescribable breath and depth. The solemn rise of the organ feels less like an instrument and more like a voice from elsewhere. My wife walked down the aisle to one of its quieter passages, and even now, I cannot hear it without having to gain my composure. Interstellar dares to reach beyond the usual bounds. It is clever, vast, thought-provoking, and, perhaps, as close to perfect as film can be.",interstellar
"The film is incredible, the special effects they give it are simply spectacular, the themes they show us are impressive and as the film progresses, more things from the beginning begin to make sense, it is a spectacular film. Juan Camilo Reyes Rodríguez 1003",interstellar

"Interstellar is an epic journey about saving humanity when Earth is no longer enough. A group of explorers travels beyond the stars, facing time, space, and their own limits. Visually stunning and emotionally deep, it’s a story that makes you think—and feel. JORGE FRANCO",interstellar
"A Journey Through Time, Love, and Memory. I don’t exactly remember the first time I watched Interstellar, but it was probably in 2014 or 2015. I also couldn’t say how many times I’ve seen it because it’s probably too many to count. Today, after almost a decade of loving it, I’m going to watch it for the first time in IMAX, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its release. The movie tells the story of Cooper, who, with the help of his daughter, embarks on an adventure where he becomes the one chosen to save humanity. More than just a simple story based on the typical “hero’s journey,” Interstellar offers a wide range of complex themes to reflect on. It is a movie deeply influenced by science. Since it’s about space travel, the filmmakers made sure everything shown on screen was as realistic as possible. This wouldn’t have been achievable without the work of Kip Thorne. Not only did he manage to bring a realistic black hole to life for the first time, but he also contributed to making other scenes iconic, such as the journey through a wormhole, the visit to Miller’s planet, or the enigmatic Tesseract. I understand that for many people, the ending—or more specifically, the Tesseract scene—can be confusing or even nonsensical. I’ve read many critiques about how love ends up being the key to this story. However, for me, the Tesseract scene and everything related to love in this movie are entirely necessary. I feel it gives the film a touch that is perhaps out of the ordinary or unexpected, something only Interstellar could achieve. Yes, I acknowledge it’s an ambitious story, but connecting the entire narrative through time in Murph’s room, represented as a Tesseract, is simply ingenious. To all this scientific accuracy, a deeply emotional story is added, especially the relationship between a father and his daughter, which is the emotional core of the film. And here lies one of the movie’s most powerful messages: ""Love is the one thing that we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space."" This phrase perfectly encapsulates the essence of Interstellar. The powerful score by Hans Zimmer elevates the experience, creating compositions that not only accompany the film but transcend it, becoming a part of popular culture, much like 2001: A Space Odyssey. It’s impossible not to highlight the screenplay by Jonathan Nolan and the direction by Christopher Nolan. Together, they created a masterpiece that, at least for me, wouldn’t have had the same impact without their impeccable vision. In 2014, my father passed away. It was a devastating experience that not only marked my life but also forced me to grow up and see the world from a completely different perspective. When I first watched Interstellar, whether it was that same year or the next, I couldn’t help but relate it to my loss. The story of a father who leaves with the heartbreaking possibility of never seeing his daughter again touched me deeply. The scene where Cooper reunites with his daughter impacted me in a way I had never experienced in cinema before. It was as if, for a moment, I could relive the connection I had lost. Every time I watch it again, those emotions resurface with the same intensity, making Interstellar more than just a movie for me: it’s a reflection of my feelings and memories. Interstellar isn’t simply my favorite movie because I think it’s good; it’s my favorite because of everything it represents for me and the way it marked an important stage in my life. I love the way time is used in this film. So much so that after watching it, time became something I think about constantly to this day. As Professor Brand says: ""I'm not afraid of death. I'm an old physicist - I'm afraid of time."" If someone like me is looking for movies that blend science, emotion, and a deep message, I can’t recommend this masterpiece enough. It’s a unique experience that not only invites reflection but also leaves a mark in the deepest parts of the heart. I’m sure that, like me, those who watch it will find something special that makes it unforgettable.",interstellar
"Hernan David Chaparro Rojas A deep film that blends science, love, and hope. Visually stunning with an unforgettable soundtrack. The story questions time, space, and Family bonds. It makes you reflect on humanity’s future. Perfect for those who love emotional.",interstellar
Best movie I have ever watched in my life. It has complex dilemman and is an emotional ride. It brings you to see Lifes beauty and the cherish your relatives whilst you still have them. Truly a tear shedder for me.,interstellar
"Interstellar quenches your thirst for a heartfelt epic, while still managing to be thought-provoking and intellectual. Intersellar is one of those movies that you will make your kids and grandkids watch with you.",interstellar
"Such a beautiful movie that delivers such a strong message about human connection, love, and family. Another great Nolan classic where the big theme is family. Cooper inspired so many, and his love for Murph just broke my heart. Incredible graphics, beautiful acting, and unforgettable story. If you love sci-fi and space-travel movies, Interstellar should be your  on the list.",interstellar
"A film that will always invoke wonder as you take to the stars. What makes this so special is at the center of this Gargantuan blockbuster is the story of the relationship between a father and child. In the end, we all cling to the promises our guardians make to us.",interstellar
"This film is good, it is slow, and very mind boggling, but that also makes it great. it has such emotional depth with Cooper. it can be gut wrenching. It truly felt like a mystery every step of the way. If you love space and Drama this is the movie for you.",interstellar
"The best movie I have ever seen. I keep searching the feelings that this movie maked in me when I seen it, and I haven't found them. 10/10 OBVIOUSLY MUST-SEE.",interstellar
"I can see why it has a 73%, due to stilted or overly sentimental dialogue, huge chunks of it that don’t make much sense to science, heavy exposition and overall a shitty script. However, it has groundbreaking visual effects that still look good today and are the best practical effects since 2001: A Space Odyssey. Speaking of 2001, Interstellar has been heavily influenced by it. For example: the wormhole, the designs, the blow the bolts part, and the AI. In fact, it’s so influenced that it loses originality. Now, back to the pros. The film is very well acted and the character bond scenes between Cooper and his daughter Murphy are (mostly) when the script doesn’t’t screw up. It also has good tension, a good start and end as well. It also has good scientific accuracy when it makes sense. That’s about all the pros, but there are a couple of last few cons. The film is so damn long and it drags, and by the climax you are so exhausted by emotion tension that it hard is a climax. In fact, it feels like a trilogy, and it’s almost long enough to be a trilogy. It’s already long enough to be 2 films. Overall, it’s fine, but it’s flaws are still massive as hell. At least 2001 had minimal plot holes and made sense if you watched it several times, but this can’t and never will live up to the cinematic masterpiece that changed cinema forever, but it is not bad by any means.",interstellar
"Arguably one of the best films of the century, complete with incredible acting, ground-breaking visual effects & taut direction. Not to mention, it literally forwarded science in regards to what we know about space.",interstellar
a cinematic spectacle unrivaled in breadth and tone. there is equal parts subtext and character nuance buried deep in this emotional opus by the master christopher nolan. what if love transcends space like gravity and time?,interstellar
"I truly and deeply enjoyed this movie. It made me feel not only being the nerd I am, but also what it can be like to be a father that would do anything for his children. I strongly recommend watching this masterpiece!",interstellar
"Simplemente increíble, es una de esas películas que uno debe ver antes de dejar este mundo. Ya dejando el deleite, la película es muy buena en cuanto a realismo, en sus personajes y la física que se habla en la misma, mientras que el mensaje e intención de la película tiene notas melancólicas, eso sí, la película te pone nervioso varias veces, así que una pequeña advertencia a quienes tengan problemas del corazón.",interstellar
"Interstellar isn’t just a film — it’s an experience that stays with you. You watch it once for the story, and again for what it quietly tells you.",interstellar
"An interesting concept and a touch of 'Sixth Sense' but I did find it over long and slow. I couldn't help being distract by the fact that Anne Hathaway's geometric hair cut, that could only have been cut by a skilled hair dresser, didn't change - at all, not even a quarter inch of growth - all the way through the film.",interstellar
"Good watch! I really do appreciate this movie, and how much it really shows about the Earth. This film is really sad :(. Especialy the ending. That honestly really hurt. Some of the characters I really enjoyed. Murph is a good example. All in all, great movie, also bingeable.",interstellar
"This is such a great movie. Technically complex and compelling. The characters are incredible, and the relationships between the main character and his children is profoundly moving. The arc of the story is very satisfying and the music is perfect for the film. Great themes that are so relevant for our times with so many quotable lines. ""Six billion people; just imagine that, and every last one of them trying to have it all.” – Donald.. Nothing but a must-see.",interstellar
"I think a movie this strong comes along maybe once every 20 years. Deeply emotionally provocative; it made me cry half a dozen times, and I very rarely cry watching movies. Utterly immersive, completely gripping, truly compelling. The acting was phenomenal. The dialog was superb. The story was captivating. Many moments were heart wrenching. It was uplifting without being sappy. It has one of the best scores I've ever heard. The pacing was deeply satisfying. Intelligence and humanity pervaded the whole thing in a way that is extraordinarily rare. With a few notable exceptions, the science was shockingly accurate, and it used that to propel the story, which is something I've never seen; usually scientific accuracy and narrative freedom are seen as at odds. I've never seen a movie like this. I'm in awe.",interstellar
"I'm sorry i did not not like this movie, so slow and the everything about this seamed outdated. I had to keep stopping this movie because it was so boring. It got to the point i could only watch 40% of the movie and then i just gave up.",interstellar
"Low grade hollywood dialogue, a little bit of the Batman voice from Matthew, terrible acting/directing for poor Anna Hathaway who ruins the movie with an unbelievable performance, though she was trying her best, the dialogue, the whole thing, is EFFECTS BASED with famous faces, to draw you into a long, boring LAMENESS.",interstellar
"Interstellar is more than just a science fiction film — it’s a deeply emotional exploration of love, sacrifice, and the human spirit. Christopher Nolan delivers a visually stunning and intellectually ambitious masterpiece that reaches for the stars while staying grounded in heart and humanity. The performances are outstanding, with Matthew McConaughey delivering one of his most powerful roles. Hans Zimmer’s score is a force of its own — haunting, beautiful, and unforgettable. The visuals are jaw-dropping, but it’s the film’s emotional core that truly sets it apart. Interstellar dares to ask big questions about our place in the universe while never losing sight of what makes us human. It’s a film that demands your attention — and rewards it with an experience that’s both epic and deeply personal. A modern sci-fi classic that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",interstellar
"Incredible. Such an amazing writting and not to mention the visuals and the use of the camera. You are going to be amazed for sure with all these ""physics"" ideas and knowledge that the film manages (even though there is obviously fiction). Well written characters, mind blowing stuff everywhere and a sad or ""we did it, but at what cost?"" ending. P.D. Amazing music",interstellar
"The movie is too long and for some reason is very complicated for no reason at all. Mankind is not made for any other world. We do not have to mess with space and time. And definitely no need to send ourselves from the present just so we could talk to ourselves in past and change the future, lol. It will never work. And also, I would never leave my baby for anyone...",interstellar
"Christopher Nolan delivers yet another cinematic masterpiece with Interstellar. This breathtaking film, anchored by a mesmerizing performance from Matthew McConaughey, transcends the boundaries of space and time, urging viewers to ponder the vastness of the universe and the profound beauty of life. It’s a story that stirs the soul, leaving you in awe of both human connection and the wonders that lie beyond our world. As the film poignantly reminds us, “Love is the one thing we are capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.” Genuinely the greatest movie ever made, with a soundtrack that is nothing short of perfection.",interstellar
I am glad I got to re-watch it in 70mm. Still like it as much as I liked it the first time I watched it.,interstellar
"Intersteller is an absolute masterpiece, from the visuals to the emotions that I have never experienced in a movie before. The direction is just perfect. This movie definitely makes you think and question what is real and what is sci-fi. Not a movie for the faint hearted.",interstellar
"I’m a fan of Nolan’s work, but I find this film to be highly overrated. The script feels contrived and overly sentimental, seemingly crafted more to emotionally manipulate the audience than to tell a coherent story. Despite a top-tier cast, the performances come off as surprisingly mediocre.",interstellar
This movie shocked me i thought it was going to be a fun movie but the plot twist was so shocking it made it one of my favorite movies.,interstellar
"Interstellar isn’t just a sci-fi movie; it’s an experience. The visuals are insane, the soundtrack is unreal, and the story hits way deeper than you expect. Yeah, it’s a little complex at times, but that’s part of what makes it so good. It’s not just about space travel; it’s about love, time, and what we’re willing to sacrifice. Easily one of the most powerful films I’ve ever seen.",interstellar
"Interstellar is hands down my favorite movie. As someone who's deeply interested in science, space, and research, it completely blew my mind. The way it blends real scientific theories with emotional storytelling is just brilliant. Watching the characters travel through wormholes, experience time dilation, and explore unknown planets felt like a dream come true for a space enthusiast like me. It’s more than just a sci-fi movie—it made me think, wonder, and feel all at once.",interstellar
"Interstellar is a timeless sci-fi classic. With his signature narrative structure, editing, and visual language, Christopher Nolan brings an unprecedented sense of beauty and philosophical depth to the space film genre.",interstellar
"Honestly, it's pretty funny that the audience scores for this are the same as the Minecraft movie. That just goes to show how this platform might not be the best when regarding objective scores. But that's what IMDb is for. Still, incredible movie can't say nothing more.",interstellar
"The soundtrack is so unbearably loud that it drowns out a lot of the mumbled dialogue between characters. The final revelation is filled with hubris and left me wondering why it needed nearly 3 hours just to get there. Also, I read in an interview with Elon Musk that this is his favorite movie. I hope that he was joking when he said that. Overall, a lovely Sunday afternoon spent on something that proved to be not worth the effort or lost time. There's no space-time wormhole for that!",interstellar
"Interstellar is a banger of a movie. i never seen a movie where after watching it, my heart starts beating crazy for the next couple of days feeling traumatized about what i just witnessed. the great thing i love about interstellar is how scientifically accurate it is. i love all the characters and visuals. the only particular flaw i have with this movie is that there are some dull scenes. but this movie still shocked me. overall, if you love sci-fi, you will love this movie, 9/10.",interstellar
The title in the movie is INTERSTELLAR. The director is Christopher Nolan and leads accord are Matthew McConaughey Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway. The movie release in twenty eleven ( 2011 ). The story take about the earth is hard to life but 4 astronaut went wormhole. The astronaut are going to saved the earth?? The acting is very interesting because the main character play between the sadness and enjoy. The setting is very beautiful exemple for the scene in field the director plantes 500 acres of Hector . Finaly the movie is interesting because is a subject current affairs with the hurricane in USA.,interstellar
"Interstellar is a movie I can watch over and over again and never lose interest. It is the perfect mix of sci-fi, drama, and action with a great story that leaves you laughing, crying, sitting at the edge of your seat, and hoping it never ends.",interstellar
Interstellar is stellar! Its one of my go to movies. Soundtrack is great. Father daughter dynamic is touching . Trips in space do not disapoint.,interstellar
"my favorite movie of all time, watched it for the first time a few weeks ago. i hate myself for not getting to see it in theatres. i love everything about this movie and it honestly changed my life",interstellar
"Arguably my favorite movie of all time. every single thing about it. I don't know what it is or how he does it, but Christopher Nolan delivered. If you haven't seen this movie, I totally recommend. One of the best Sci-Fi thrillers to ever grace media.",interstellar
"Directed by the geant Christopher Nolan, Interstellar tells the story of Matthew McConaughey. The character is a retirement astronaut. With her daughter Murph, they find a message of the nasa, for save the people and find an other planet with other astronauts. The plot seems to be absorbing. The specials effects are just incredible, we forgot that the movie is make with green background and the photography he’s impressive. Than the acting performance, there is nothing to tell about just spectacular !! When I watch the movie I crying all my tears, laugh, irritated. Finally, I find this film incredible, maybe the best film ever. Just watch and you will love it !",interstellar
"Interstellar is another movie where Christopher Nolan hits the ball out of the park. Between the absolute beauty that is the music by Hans Zimmer, and the absolute top-tier acting performance that Matthew McConaughey delivers (especially those yells and cries my god), it is a must-watch for any fan of space exploration. Christopher Nolan's Sci-fi adventure is also surprisingly more science than fiction. The way he uses no sound when you're looking at the movie from space is peak genius. My only real negative is that the movie's length is a bit tedious, and while watching it the first hour is definitely the hardest to get through due to massive exposition dumps. But when you finish the movie, it does feel very complete and everything comes full circle. The pacing is near exceptional, however, do pay attention to details the movie drops because like my algebra class, this story flies like a rocket. Now onto spoiler territory, the concept of wormholes and time dilation is stellar, not pun intended. The way Cooper just sacrifices himself by going into the tesseract felt like the scene was shooting bullets at my heart. And the pure emotion Matthew McConaughey is putting into his voice when he's telling Murphy to stay could make the toughest grown men cry, I'm sure of it. Overall, if you're looking for an emotional space movie, and you're willing to sit through nearly 3 hours of adventure, Interstellar is the perfect watch.",interstellar
"No amount of words or phrases can even begin to describe the masterpiece that is Interstellar. I have seen this film several times before watching it in theaters but let me just say it is an indescribable feeling getting the chance to watch this in the theater, in IMAX nonetheless. I truly felt transported. Interstellar pushes our views as well as our thoughts beyond time and space and out as far as other dimensions. It allows us to go beyond the limit of our knowledge regarding space and time and travelling through them and to think deeper than just what is on our own planet. You just have to be willing to look up at the sky and wander and be willing to explore.",interstellar
This movie is long but epic. Clumsy in some spots but generally enjoyable and the payoff at the end is well worth the time invested.,interstellar
"10/10! I wish I could watch the movie for the first time, just to experience the amazing crescendo of storytelling all over again. From the performances to the dialogue to the scoring and of course the cinematography, this movie is a masterpiece and has earned its right to be called a “cult classic”.",interstellar
"I’m not sure what the hype is over this movie. Yes, I am a Christopher Nolan fan and a Matthew McConaughey fan, but there’s something about this that doesn’t hit the way it should. Maybe it’s pretending to be a movie with a deep meaning or MM’s constant mumbling but I don’t like it as much as I thought I would.",interstellar
"This is one of the greatest sci-fi movies I've ever seen. It had beautiful and stunning visuals, and its story was intriguing. I highly recommend this for fans of sci-fi!",interstellar
"Thought provoking, yes. But equally headache provoking when I found myself hopelessly adrift in the abstractions of quantum mechanics and theoretical physics. I got the gist of the narrative but the finer points were lost on me. Way too much thrown at the audience in the span of two hours that felt more like a hundred years. The only thing that kept me watching were the special effects and those ridiculous looking robots.",interstellar
"Best movie of all time. Everything about it to the last detail is amazing, music just heavenly and even more in IMAX 70MM.. movie will never get old no matter how many times I watch",interstellar
"I loved this movie. It was super emotional and I was all in once it started. I think that certain characters were unnecessary and I didn’t understand their motives but visually, this might be the best movie I’ve ever seen.",interstellar
"Never in my life i experienced this kind of thing, the re releasing experience was on another level this kind of movies are literally made once in an lifetime.",interstellar
"A grossly overrated science fiction film with some compelling real-life scientific concepts, but addled with ludicrous fantasy, contrived melodrama, and bleak cynicism disguised as optimism.",interstellar
Everything I expected and then some. I wish I got the chance to see it one more time in IMAX! Already looking forward to the 20th anniversary. Most beautiful movie ever.,interstellar
Interstellar was and still one of the best movies I've ever watched in my whole life and I think there's no other banger that could stand this masterpiece.,interstellar
My favourite film of all time! So chilling to know that the money/ research that went into this helped science. Such an epic tale and it’s so amazing to know this was part of something bigger!,interstellar
"Not as good as inception but still one of the greatest movies of all time. It is thought provoking, thrilling, masterful, and simply put, brilliant.",interstellar
"The most gut wrenching movie of all time: Interstellar I have never cried so much to a single movie. I watched it without knowing my what it was actually about and I now I feel like I know so much but nothing at all. My heart feels empty and heavy after watching this cinematic masterpiece. No amount of awards could amount to how beautiful and psychologically powerful this film is. I don’t think there couldn’t ever be a movie as aspiring and deep as this one. I cried so many times, bawling my eyes out, snot everywhere because my I couldn’t handle the emotions this movie brought me. There so much I want to stay about this movie but nothing amount of words can get my point across of how much this movie changed me and my perspective on life and humanity itself. The idea of time has always been fascinating to me and now I feel so overwhelmed with curiosity over the matter that I don’t know what to do. A movie has never left me in such shambles as this has. I seriously can not stress it enough that it is the greatest film masterpiece of all time and I dearly hope every generation can come to appreciate this movie no matter how the world ends. I don’t know what will happen in the near future of even thousands of years into the future. Maybe life will become what this movie is? Whatever what life may become, I hope that life continues to live, through all the turmoil and the pain, the unknown, the fear, everything. That is life and life continues on even when humanity is gone. I don’t know what else to say, I can’t get my thoughts into words.",interstellar
"Interesting plot and storytelling, with consistent tension and development. Acting is great. This all combines to keep the viewer invested in both the story and thr characters. I recommend it if you like Sci-Fi and slowburn tension.",interstellar
"Absolutely breathtaking. This was my first time seeing this movie and I can't believe I missed out on such an excellent movie. The visuals were stunning, the plot was beautifully written, and I don't know a whole lot about physics but I believe Nolan did his research very well.",interstellar
"My kids are not watching this movie with me, we would bawl our eyes out - Matthew McConaughey knew exactly how to deliver the most gut-wrenching performance; Beyond the space and sci-fi theme, the film is a profound metaphor for time, the choices we make, and the enduring power of love. Thank you Christopher Nolan & The Interstellar Team",interstellar
"My absolute favourite movie. The original Hans Zimmer soundtrack is so emotional and amazing. If you're a movie lover like me, you will adore this movie. It has it's sad moments, a few funny moments. It's just so good. I've watched it quite a few times and I will definitely watch it more.",interstellar
"It was the only movie that made me cry, it was the only movie I watched for the first time and until now the only time it became my favorite movie, Interstellar for me, is a masterpiece that will never be replaced.",interstellar
"The end bit was a bit silly and deflating. Hard to know what to do with this thing, but it just didn't quite come off in what was otherwise a solid movie.",interstellar
Bird brain characters and a comedy robot in a serious space movie is a recipe for overpowering feelings of DISDAIN. This guy Chris Nolan has made numerous movies that I can't watch.,interstellar
"Let me get this straight-this movie is a cinematic MASTERPIECE. The story, the music and score, the acting...everything is SO WELL DONE. In my personal opinion Matthew McConaughey completely carried this movie. He delivered such a remarkable and jaw dropping performance that left me speechless at the end. Are we even going to talk about the scene where he watches the videos from his kids?! I was in awe-and honestly a little unsettled-the whole scene because of how real his performance felt, as if he truly was a father mourning the lost years of his kids' lives, like Cooper. The way he could tap into such raw emotion, make himself cry, and deliver such an eerily authentic portrayal was almost frightening in its realism. He also had such a great onscreen bond with Mckenzie Foy that even left me in tears as we watched their relationship and bond unfold and eventually save humanity. There were many aha! Moments and the adrenaline was indeed pumping as I was mesmerized and pulled deeply into concentration on the movie. So why is this movie missing two stars? Don't get me wrong Christopher Nolan completely delivered and made me feel all the emotions he wanted viewers to feel, and while I did enjoy it, it is not a movie to take lightly. There is a lot of informational thrown at you and a lot of words the average movie watcher might not understand. I get it, it's a sci-fi movie, and a great one at that, but the end completely messed with my brain and had me scavaging the internet and Youtube for explanations. Because of this, I feel like this movie is one that you really can't talk to your friends while watching or get up to go to the bathroom since you will miss critical information. Also, there were some scenes and monologues that felt a little too long and didn't do much to drive the story forward. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Interstellar. It's an incredibly captivating and emotional film that kept me hooked from start to finish. While it can be a bit confusing at times and definitely a lot to take in, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who loves thought-provoking, visually stunning movies.",interstellar
"This movie is a mind-bending masterpiece. It combines stunning visuals, complex scientific concepts, and deep emotional storytelling. I think people either love it or find it a bit confusing. I needed to watch it twice to understand it. This movie is a must watch and I recommend it to everyone! It also reminds me of a song - Space Song by Beach House.",interstellar
So i just discovered this masterpiece is rated less than MAGIC MIKE BY TOMATOERS cristics less than magic mike.... i felt so abused i had to subscribe and tell all this ppl how much ov a joke they are. This is one of a kind. This movie is a masterpiece and you are a joke,interstellar
Very good pacing and storytelling. My only wish is that the son wasn't so cut out of the movie. It felt like Cooper only cared about Murphy which felt a bit strange.,interstellar
Great movie. I don’t know where any of the hate is from. It has a great plot and lives you wondering. It has action and more. A must watch.,interstellar
"Real hard science Science fiction instead of the usual fluff studios put out as Scifi (for example, the aliens communicating with a post apocalyptic blighted earth -- whom you never see, are said to be five-dimensional beings who communicate through gravity). The vision of this movie is big and the visual effects are even bigger, so see this on a giant home Screen or commercial theatre with big sound too. There's a human story, too, and a father and daughter promise that holds the emotional core of the story together with all the mind-bending science stuff happening. And fun visual rides happen here. Ever wonder what traveling through an actual space wormhole would look like? There are tiny flaws in the characterization in the editing of the final version, but really with a story this ambitious and heroic, who wants to quibble on that front? Finally, the whole family can see this.",interstellar
"Una película bien loca, con las 5 dimensiones. Y lo importante de estar con la familia. Los efectos especiales son de otro planeta. La recomiendo ver en cine y no en tele, la escena del agujero negro😯.",interstellar
A real life changing emotional experience that really shows the real meaning of love and what humans are capable of to achieve it the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful it helps set the scene perfectly alongside stunning visuals of space exploration Christopher Nolan absolutely nails it perfectly 10/10,interstellar
"The best science fiction movie in my mind, I always mention this one when I recommend hard science fiction movies to others. The rich knowledge of universe science and the wonderful interpretation of science fiction realism in this movie make me amazed!",interstellar
"Though a bit too slow at times, the story itself is quite cool, with a most explanatory, though quirky ending. Often too unrealistic, but with optional scientific reasoning which make it entertaining. 7/10 points!",interstellar
"To me this is basically 2001 but good. A scientifically accurate sci-fi movie that still tells a good story with an engaging emotional core. A bit confusing at times, but overall one of Chris Nolan’s most underrated films.",interstellar
"Perfect example of a director outsmarting himself and boring the audience. A+ for production value and effects. F for writing. The science behind it all is relatively sound, but Nolan gets way too ahead of himself so that while science in movies like Armageddon or The Social Network SOUNDS exciting, the science in this movie drowns you without comprehension. Rather than a twist, theres a twist within a twist within a wormhole. Good luck.",interstellar
"A decade later, this still holds up as one of the best SCI-FI and drama movies of all time. The score for this movie is nothing short of a masterpiece, perfectly matching the special effects on screen with the tone of uncertainty and exploration. The underlying themes in this movie, that humans were meant to be pioneers, and that love transcends all, ties together the plot in a way that can bring the most masculine men to tears. A movie that has become tradition to watch yearly, I cannot recommend it enough. A beautiful story of science, fantasy, action, drama, and romance, truly a movie encompassing all genres. Christopher Nolan’s greatest work",interstellar
"Star Trek episode, combine with Space Odyssey 2001 - with a confusing plot, non scientific script. McGonauge was great. Damon and Hathaway looked like they were shoved into a Subway commercial at the last minute.",interstellar
I love the movie.Great visual effect and it very heartbreaking movie.It was very great that it is one of the most best space movies I ever watched.,interstellar
"It transcends everything. The story, the background score, the CGI , the visuals Everything just keeps you hooked. The expressions of Matthew, the bond between him and little Mackenzie is so heart wrenching . An absolute must watch. It will start making you believe in a higher purpose",interstellar
"It's definitely not my favorite science fiction movie. Its visuals and cinematography are really great. But the scenario, which was written with logical errors and too many theories, did not appeal to me. There is no physical explanation of the planets they go to. Also, the end of the movie ends with a deus ex machina.",interstellar
amazing beautiful perfect great awesome also so sad and so educating and eventful and makes you think about life pls watch this movie at least once in ur life!!!!!,interstellar
"Interstellar is an extravagant film that visually captivates with its stunning shots and a story that takes you on an exhilarating journey through the speed of light, immersing you in the profound concepts of time and space. Although the deep space premise might unsettle some viewers, Christopher Nolan masterfully weaves an emotional tapestry with performances from Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway, which shine like shooting stars, illuminating the narrative. Grading: A",interstellar
"Very good movie definitely recommend if you like space and time travel. I watched this movie around the time I started getting into astronomy. I started reading about the stars in galaxies and I could tell you so much but I’m gonna keep it simple this movie is long, but definitely worth the while. The actors were great and the way it was put together was just brilliant. I definitely recommend.",interstellar
"At almost three hours, it presents an interesting enough story to go by really quick. Although the technology in this movie is decades, if not centuries away, there's just this one part that strays from the boundaries of science that risks spoiling the rest of what's a great story",interstellar
"This film is neither an incredible masterpiece, nor is it complete rubbish. It could have been an incredible masterpiece, delving heavily into explaining in layman‘s terms the idea of time and space and higher quantum physics, but unfortunately, it also wanted to appeal to a really ignorant audience that just wants to see some stars running around perhaps going to be in love or perhaps angry with each other etc. Also, it’s always nice to have a few drama scenes with gizmos and gadgets and funny little robot beings. Stupid people like this. In the end, Nolan didn’t really know which direction he was going in, and I think he shoved in as much physics stuff as he could at the end movie which is what I believe He really wanted to make -which was an intelligent film about the fifth dimension or whatever - so he shoved it all roughly in in the last hour or so of the flic. He then tied it all together with an emotional ending with Matthew McConaughey meeting his old, almost dead daughter. It’s somewhat worth a watch and I would recommend it for anyone trying to have some fun with the elaborate ideas of what we are attempting to strive for as a human species, but I wouldn’t be upset with them if they decided they didn’t want to watch it because you’re not really gonna learn anything New. An admirable Attempt but alas a mediocre one.",interstellar
Best movie I’ve seen all year and one of the best movies I’ve seen on the last 15 years. I can’t wait for it to come to IMAX.,interstellar
One of the top 20 movies ever made. If like a lot of Science in your Fiction this is for you. Of course if that describes you it’s probable that you have your own gushing review.,interstellar
"I was somewhat excited to see this movie given all the great reviews but was somewhat disappointed..First, the movie is too long and drags in parts. Second, there was too much science talk on too many issues to make the plot seem plausible but in the end, I was totally confused and almost didn't care. If the movie maybe limited itself to 2-3 issues with science talk, It would have been better. Less would have definitely been more for the movie Also some of the scenes were ridiculous including Matt Damon and Matthew McConaughey fighting on a foreign planet..Laughable! Acting generally, Ok..Some of the themes were Ok...Overall, not a Bad Movie but definitely an overrated one..",interstellar
"This is just everything you want in a film. Drama, plot, acting and an incredible soundtrack from the great Hans Zimmer. Arguably Nolan’s best film in a great selection. I couldn’t recommend this one highly enough.",interstellar
One of the best sci-fi movies ever. Great cast and visual effects. The fact that this movie did not win multiple Oscars is an absolute shame.,interstellar
"Although I did enjoy the movie, I just felt it never quite reaches your expectations. The whole cast carry it off, the concept has depth but the end doesnt leave you with a wow - still worth a watch and am sure I will watch it again a few times to see what I missed the last time",interstellar
The most profound father/ son bond I have seen in a movie. Great photography and acting with many memorable breathtaking scenes. It gets better and better the more you watch it. As it significantly circulates about the passing of time! This film will definitely stand the test of time.,interstellar
"Esta película es una joya. Cada escena, cada encuadre, cada nota de su banda sonora crean una experiencia inolvidable. Es más que cine; es arte puro, una obra hermosa que deja huella en el alma.",interstellar
"Always drawn back to it by it's layers. Entertaining at each viewing, but for an ever-evolving understanding. By the third viewing, I got it. And I found myself weeping at the under-story. It has changed me.",interstellar
A movie that intrigues you the entire time you’re watching it. There’s a reason this movie is talked about so much it uses actual scientific theory to make a science fiction movie which leads to a movie that doesn’t come off as childish even when it’s making you stretch your imagination and along with this amazing use of science the plot is emotional and heartfelt making you feel for these characters.,interstellar
This masterpiece made me and my friend break out into a passionate orgy in the theatre because we could not control ourselves. That's how good it is.,interstellar
"The best movie for me personally , the drama and the emotions provoked by every intense parts makes it incredible,after seeing this movie a few times,Im still thinking that deserved more awards on the Oscars.",interstellar
"i love the movie, I knew that going in, so the movie itself gets a 5 star, but the imax version upscaled the volume a little too much. I felt like I was getting whiplash between the quiet and loud scenes.",interstellar
"Great Movie !! If you're an astronomy nerd like me, you're bound to like this movie; - Story : 10/10; - Theme/Music : 10/10; this movie is juste beautiful.",interstellar
"I first watched this film when it was released and didn't pay attention to anything other than it's long running time. What a selfish fool I was! Watching it again ten years later after all of my life's experience, it is an utter masterpiece! The music, the artistry, the out of this earth visions. Incredible",interstellar
"I missed it at the movies the first time around. IMAX experience came up, and my daughter and I jumped on it. We were mesmerized. An enlightening experience.",interstellar
Wow. Visually this movie was great. Kept you on the edge of the seat and personally kept me in engaged into the story. Not much of a Sci-Fi guy but this was good. I needed the ending explained to me like a 5 year old but that's OK. Giving this a 3.5 out of 5. Good movie.,interstellar
"I love this movie so much! Even though the graphics are a bit outdated at times, the sheer impact of the plot of this movie is amazing! And such great acting from all the characters.",interstellar
"It was a phenomenal experience to finally be able to watch this on an IMAX screen! The acoustics alone had the ability to make you dissolve and experience the movie as though you were apart of it, not simply watching!",interstellar
"Seldom do I enjoy watching a science fiction movie, but this peace blew me away. Not only is the storyline catchy, but also the special effects are outstanding, and all the actors did a remarkable job, because it was able to get me fully immersed into a three hours long sci-fi film. Recommend 100%.",interstellar
"I love this movie! Even if your not into science fiction this is definitely a movie that everyone should see at some point. This movie does a great job at making you think outside the box at what could really be out there. Casting was great, cgi was outstanding, but one of my favorite moments in the movie is when they first get to space and it goes completely silent, AMAZING!",interstellar
"Me parece increíble que para el tiempo que dura jamás se me hizo larga, todo tiene un fin, todo termina cuadrando, no le sobra nada.",interstellar
Every thing about this film is perfect. The Acting. The Score. Everything. Nolan is truly a master of the film and this film is the best demonstration of that. 10/10 without a doubt.,interstellar
Wonderful. Both in acting and in the overall story. This movie hit a special place in my heart that no other science fiction movie could achieve.,interstellar
"Interstellar is another technical wonder by Nolan which is flawless in cinematography, character development, world building and performances. However, the thing that holds it back is its intellectual quotient which makes it come across as confusing rather than intelligent.",interstellar
I had to take two stabs at this movie to truly understand the magnificence of the theme. Absolutely loved it. Murph and Coops love which transcends time and space is truly moving. Loved it,interstellar
"This could have been a majestic film save for Matthew McC. Continually giving the ""Im a hard man, and every woman drools over me"" as Cooper. What dreadful casting. But its personal opinion and what do I know?",interstellar
"Easily the best cinematic experience I've ever had in my life, although in my favorite film, the feeling that is brought through the direction, art, script, acting and most importantly, THE MUSIC, simply the best and most striking soundtrack ever made in the cinema, an incredible experience at home but necessary at the cinema.",interstellar
One of my favorite original scores and films of all time this was my first time enjoying it on the big screen. A film full of thought and wonder.,interstellar
"After many times, and the second time since I understand it, I now can say that I don’t buy it. The quantics resource it’s used too much, and the script it gets to a point that everyone is saying things that nobody understands and it’s sounds gibberish, so no Mr. Nolan this I don’t like.",interstellar
"This movie for me is pretty much perfection, the cinematography, the writing and the acting all out together brilliantly. This could possibly be for me the greatest movie of all time!! DO NOT SKIP 10/10",interstellar
"Buena pelicula. Banda sonora espectacular, el hecho que te tome tiempo en contar la historia y establecer relación entre personajes la hace especial. El tema audiovisual es sublime, pelicula recomendada, al inicio pensarás que demora mucho pero al final aplaudirás de la excitación.",interstellar
"I'm 15 years old now and watched the movie for the first time when I was 12. Since then I have seen the movie probably about 13 times, and feel what most captivated me the most about this movie was the yes, the visuals and acting, but what captured me the most was the music. The music in the movie is absolutely remarkable and I want to thank Hans Zimmer for making me want to learn to play the main theme and to learn how to play the piano in the first place. Recently I played it for my school talent show and received a standing ovation. Thank Hans Zimmer and thank you Christopher Nolen.",interstellar
"Absolutely, unequivocally, the most beautiful, mind altering, sensational film I have ever watched. This is the only movie in history I have ever given a 10/10 (5/5 here). This film is absolutely worth the watch, especially if you have any interest in theoretical space/time/exploration. I had been told for years to watch this film, never listened, but I couldn’t be more grateful that I did before it hit netflix. In fact, I made my account soulfully to leave this review. Please, if you see this, do yourself a favor and watch this film.",interstellar
Created an account to post a review on this movie. It is mind bending and thought-provoking. The emotions this movie makes you feel are so deep and real. This movie is an all time great. An instant classic.,interstellar
"While ""Interstellar"" undeniably presents a sophisticated, science-fiction adventure, it stands apart by rooting its story in a believable family drama. Director Christopher Nolan gets the very best out of his cast and crew to transport audiences into both a dystopian future and the far-reaching corners of outer space. Overall, the film is a cinematic experience that is both satisfying to watch and intriguing to contemplate.",interstellar
"Truthfully I had always heard about Interstellar. I always knew the hype that surrounded it, but to believe that 2014 film would be one of the greatest ever, would've been hard for me to swallow. I love new films, but I've always known and believed that oldies are where it's at, or was, and that nothing will ever come close. But I can say now, after watching this movie, I understand what THEY (pun intended) were talking about. I love movies, and I've watched so very many, but I promise you, this one is touching. It'll make you laugh, and it it'll definitely make you cry. This is peak cinema, and I know I'm just another review to you, and I am not currently a top critic, but I promise you, this is one of the greatest films you'll ever see, at least it was for me.",interstellar
"This movie is perfection! The score, the visuals, the story, the acting are all top notch. This movie will definitely move you and hit you right in the feels.",interstellar
"That movie was crazy! Some parts of the movie are a bit confusing for people but somehow I wasn’t confused. This is in my top five movies of all time. I also love the visuals and story of this movie. I don’t care if you have a short attention span, you need to see this.",interstellar
"Awful film. The good parts are good space visuals and an interesting subtheme that explores the idea of time relativity. The rest of the film is overblown and disjointed. All of the performers were good but the story and pacing felt strained the whole movie. Character motivations were routinely skipped over, actions seemed to come out of nowhere. I read another review that summed it up nicely, great ideas don't translate into great movies. Skip it.",interstellar
"i am blown away and overtaken. i’ve heard of, but never seen, this film before & boy am i glad i tuned in. though its a lengthy watch, it didn’t feel like it. i felt fully immersed in their world, their timeline. i found the science and physics of it all fascinating, and to balance it out with the emotional stories & moments.. i sobbed several times. what an outstanding film.",interstellar
"Visually stunning, cinematography is excellent, emotionally gut wrenching. An adventure that leaves disbelief suspended (for the most part) and your heart invested (for the most part) in this beautifully shot, beautifully art directed and very well told (for the most part) masterpiece. Connecting a real life existential and relatable human condition with an epic sci fi. One of my top 5.",interstellar
"L'un de mes films préféré de science-fiction, avec un casting particulièrement intéressant. La dernière demi étoile que je n'attribue pas pour ce film vient de son côté trop américanisé et rocambolesque par moment qui nous sort du film.",interstellar
"One of the best movies of the 2010s, a must see masterpiece. Zimmer does an amazing job with the score that really draws the audience in.",interstellar
"Wow. Some of McConaughey's acting in the beginning is a little goofy, and I'm not the biggest Anne Hathaway fan, but who cares. This is a magnificent epic of a movie and what a sci fi movie should be. Incredible detail and it all works at least to a non-scientist like myself. Man, Nolan outdid himself with this one. I love how there's no antagonist until two thirds through the movie.",interstellar
"Cinema at its finest. Interstellar is visually breathtaking, it delivers a beautifully laid out, well connected story. It highlights strong themes, the acting from McConaughey is perfect, and the film overall takes you on an emotional, resonant, thought-provoking journey that you enjoy every second of.",interstellar
"It’s really good but just short of great. I respect what it tried to do but ultimately it was too long and tried a bit too hard. Even with its shortcomings it was still pretty damn good and worth a watch, especially if seen in IMax.",interstellar
"I think you have to approach this film as a space fantasy rather than as science fiction. It is simply far beyond suspension of disbelief, not least when the NASA board room rolls back a single flimsy wall to reveal its interstellar rocket. The ""ghost"" behind the bookshelf is clever, yet somehow in the end disappointing as a plot device. A tremendous feat of effects and cinematography, but I personally need a bit more believability.",interstellar
"This movie had so much potential…. But it didn’t reach it. My husband and I had tears in our eyes during one part, but the rest of the movie was confusing, and it didn’t need to be. I was stuck between “am I dumb, and just not understanding the science talk” or “is this a bad movie”. Came to the conclusion that it is just a bad movie.",interstellar
"Nolan’s ""Interstellar"" is a sadly amazing film that blends stunning visuals with an emotional storyline. The breathtaking cinematography and powerful performances make it unforgettable, but its themes of love and loss leave a bittersweet feeling.",interstellar
I thought it was a great movie but the ending (SPOILER ALERT) was a little confusing .... Did Cooper make it home? Where was Brand??,interstellar
It was the best movie I have ever seen because of the Galaxy of all the universes our universes other universes is going by other timelines. It's not just our dimension it's other dimensions too. we are all here to make everything better not relax and be selfish. We are the people who will make everything better so that's why we all matter and that's why we're here to make everything better.,interstellar
"Experiencing Christopher Nolans Interstellar on a huge screen, combined with feeling the music/sounds and bass in your seat made for an unforgettable experience, especially with a movie that has such an amazing soundtrack.",interstellar
Just re-saw it at the cinema after 10 years and I was glued to my seat. I had forgotten what a masterpiece this movie it.,interstellar
"What a load of old rubbish. Just another tired remake 2001. Hollywood fails to understand (yet again) that just sticking a movie star in a space helmet does not make entertainment. I suggest this movie be renamed Incoherent. In this space movie, everyone will hear you scream.",interstellar
"IMO top 2 movie all-time for Chris Nolan. The other is Inception which is . Everything else follows and I've seen all of them. Yes Oppenheimer won an Oscar but let's be real it doesn't hold a candle to Inception or Interstellar, which is Nolan's bread and butter, sci-fi and action.",interstellar
"Everytime i see this movie i understand something new like every time..... the murphy's law, the upper dimension beings, the wormhole and everything was mind bogling. like the connection of the starting to the end. This movie is a ""CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE"".",interstellar
"One of the greatest movies I have ever watched , it truly tugged on my heart strings , from the music, to the bonds formed with the characters throughout the film , and the over all story line . The originality of the film played a massive part in my opinion , the complex links in the story truly grasped my overall love for the film. A truly amazing, emotional, and overall impeccable movie!!!",interstellar
I have seen this movie about 12 times but never in theaters. I was blown away. It was just as jaw dropping as the first time I saw it. Truly a timeless film.,interstellar
Like all of Nolans movies (yes including Tenet) The movie is amazing!! Leaves me in tears at the end EVERY SINGLE TIME. The only gripe I have has nothing to do with the movie but with the theater. 10:15 start time. Movie starts at 10:40 after previews and what not.,interstellar
"Nolan's, and one of the 21st Century's best. See it on the biggest screen possible. So rarely do you see any work or art so successfully address the biggest questions of our Moment, and of our species, so successfully. This is an outstanding monument to the power of Cinema.",interstellar
"This movie is well loved for good reason. This was my first time seeing it in theater as I didn't have much interest when it first came out, but I'd watched it multiple times at home. Amazing emotional experience and great story. Leaves you wondering and in thought!",interstellar
"As always this movie leaves me with a profound appreciation for cinema. Getting to see it in IMAX again took me back a decade to when I was a teenager. This movie deserves the experience an IMAX screen offers. To this day this masterpiece achieves what many movies could only dream of achieving. Not only is it visually and sonically exceptional, Its story still is as impactful as it was the first time I saw it. I will be thinking of this experience until I can see it in IMAX again.",interstellar
"A spectacular and riveting film that is thought provoking, filled with heart. My personal all time favorite movie and theater experience. I’ll never forget my first viewing on opening day. I had been looking forward to the rerelease for many years and was happy to watch it again multiple times in IMAX.",interstellar
"Interstellar is a beautiful story. Human emotion is displayed well in every aspect, minute details surround each important moment adding great depth to the story and everything involved in it. The effects are stunningly real. The soundtrack is the best part, every second of it pulls you deeper into the film.",interstellar
"On the biggest screen around it’s a film that’s marvelous. A movie about intergalactic space travel with humanity’s survival on the line, epic scenery, intense action and drama, gets a lot more immersive and grand. The way films like this have to be seen.",interstellar
"Fandango cancelled my ticket and then changed the showtime by 15 minutes, rather than just move my ticket to the second showtime. I've seen Interstellar countless times at this point, and twice in IMAX 70mm since 2014. This isn't a knock on the film, it's the greatest space film ever made and one of my personal favorites. But Fandango pulled a Ticketmaster. Therefore, 1 star.",interstellar
"Movie itself was amazing, thought provoking, motivating. Rage Rage Rage. Two people two the left of me could not stop talking though. Almost ruined it for me",interstellar
"Its like another movie, pretty different and awesome, sound and picture is aproppiate forma masterpiece like interestellar. If youve already Watch it, its a Must. If you havent, youre lucky to be able to watch it for the first time in that format",interstellar
"This movie was meant to be watched in IMAX, I wouldn’t miss out on this re-release for anything 10/10 one of the greatest films of my lifetime.",interstellar
"As the lights dimmed and the film began, I was immediately swept into the vastness of space, feeling both the enormity of the universe and the intimate struggles of humanity. Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a breathtaking journey that intertwines love, sacrifice, and the resilience of the human spirit. The stunning visuals and haunting score created an immersive experience that resonated deeply. Each performance was compelling, with emotional depth that drew me in further. Watching it on the big screen truly enhanced the impact, making it a cinematic experience that stays with you long after it ends. This film is not just a story; it’s a profound exploration of what it means to be human.",interstellar
"Seeing it on Imax re-release was one of the best theater experiences of my life, hands down. All-time score. Nolan's most thematically tight and nuanced films, equally tragic and triumphant",interstellar
"As I settled into my seat, the anticipation was palpable. The vastness of space unfolded before me, drawing me into a journey that felt both grand and intimate. Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is a breathtaking exploration of love, sacrifice, and the human spirit against the backdrop of stunning visuals and a haunting score. The performances are compelling, particularly the emotional depth brought by the cast. Watching it on the big screen was an experience that truly amplified its impact, making every moment resonate. This film is not just a story; it’s a masterpiece that lingers long after the credits roll.",interstellar
"As the film unfolded, I found myself immersed in a breathtaking journey through space and time, where humanity's survival hinged on the choices of a few brave souls. The visuals were stunning, each scene meticulously crafted, pulling me deeper into the narrative. The emotional depth of the characters resonated with me, especially the bond between father and daughter, which added a poignant layer to the already complex story. Christopher Nolan's direction is nothing short of genius, weaving together science and emotion seamlessly. Watching it on the big screen was an experience that left me in awe, reinforcing its status as a modern classic in the sci-fi genre.",interstellar
"Seen this movie several times and it’s better each and every watch. The emotions it invokes within you are unlike any other film. The music score, the acting, the pacing, the overall story.. Nothing tops it. This will forever bey top favorite movie and I would encourage everyone to see it.",interstellar
"Fantastic! Not only is this movie a must see but Nolan should be studied and exemplified as a pinnacle director. Outstanding cast, unbelievably realistic portrayal of the settings and, most importantly, the musical score makes the movie a mind bending experience.",interstellar
This movie is AMAZING!! The story is unique and the soundtrack is one of the best ever. It really adds to the overall experience. You definitely will have an emotional experience watching this movie. 5+ stars!,interstellar
Hans Zimmer is one of the greatest composers of our generation! The acting is still just as good as I remember it and the sound quality was crazy! Shook my entire seat lol,interstellar
"In the 2025 era of societal division and massive wealth inequality the sense that an uprising of the poor and downtrodden against the super wealthy and privileged classes this 2019 movie is more relevant than when it was made! Superb acting, direction and soundtrack. Brilliant movie!",joker
An amazing film taking place in a psychological setting rather than the superhero genre and Phoenix gives one of the best performances of his career.,joker
"It's by no means an easy watch but it's worth at least one viewing for the acting and cinematography alone. The themes are very relevant and well illustrated. The film can be deeply unnerving and I was on the edge of my seat for a large majority of it, but I highly reccomend it as long as you know it won't be rainbows and butterflies.",joker
Every bit as dark as I heard it was. I think that's why it took me so long to sit down and watch it finally (in 2025). 'Sympathy for the Joker in a Luigi world. I get it. 'Makes me wonder/worry how much darker humanity is going to become.,joker
Great film very intriguing and had me on the edge of my seat for the whole film Amazing effects and brilliant build up Loved this definitely recommend,joker
"There are lots of leaps of logic in this story that don't add up. The idea of a standup routine would be recorded and submitted to TV Network, and they'd think it was worth airing is a stretch. The idea that 3 people being killed on a subway would be a catalyst for a city-wide revolt is as crazy as people thinking this movie's release would lead to anarchy. And that's part of the point. We are not supposed to believe this narrative. This pity party but also self-aggrandizing tripe is the type of stuff that a psycho would come up with to justify his actions. I can see why this movie is loved by many and hated by many others. For me, I found it interesting at times, and overly pretentious in others. But hey, that's life.",joker
"Even more disturbing than that Meager Markle of Sussex interview with that other Joker, Jamie Kern Lima. Joaquin's laugh and all other reactions were more normal. Had Todd Phillips recruited Sandra Bernhard for either the role of Arthur's love interest or the ol' lady talk show guest, that would have earned another star. Don't talk shows and tv studios in general screen all guests? Ignoring this potential wide open plot hole, I found the material almost entirely sad, dour and glum with little else to offset while enduring scene by scene. Contrast this with King of Comedy or even Bonnie and Clyde. Am I out of line or ignoring something with this criticism? Fun fictoid: the producer of the Murray Franklin show was Diana Christensen, the former producer of the Howard Beale Show and Mao Tse Tung Hour on UBC.",joker
"watched Joker (2019) from director Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro and Zazie Beetz. There's only one thing that I could say about this film and that is that it's a masterpiece, a 10 out of 10. Everything was spot on from the story, the acting and the music. The film is about Arthur Fleck and he has a laughing disabilitie. He wants to be seen but he feels like he's not. Arthur did some horrible things and eventually became the Joker. The story is dark just like some other DC films. It's a good thing that it's dark because how else would you tell the story of the Joker. The story really focusses on Joker and not on other heroes or villains in Gotham like Batman. Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic as Joker. He played Joker so good that he's in my top 3 of Joker performances of all time. His acting made him so good. The laugh that he did was incredible. The amount of weight he lost for this role is insane. You could see his bones so that is how skinny he was. His dances were also great. The stair scene when he's dancing on them is the best scene in the movie. The make-up artists did an amazing job with the clown make-up. The clown make-up and his costume is different from other Jokers. The sets and film locations are beautiful. The darkness and sometimes the bright colors looked great in every scene. The music is also great. 'That's Life' is perfect for Joker. I got goosebumps from every scene when 'That's Life' played because it felt epic. I would highly recommend this film for everyone who loves DC Comics and superhero movies. The story is great and the acting is fantastic. The Oscar was well deserved for Joaquin Phoenix and always remember: ""That's Life.""",joker
"An interesting twist on the classic “joker” we all know and love. This is more of a modern day, realistic version of the Joker, I think it works a lot better this way. Joaquin did a phenomenal job as the joker, showing all the crazy, messed up emotions and action and the hysterical laughing, couldn’t think of a better actor for this role. The movie starts off a little bit loud in my opinion, there’s a lot going on at once, and music is constantly playing. It didn’t really feel like an intro, we just jumped in right away. I think this is a good and bad thing, it didn’t really feel like I had time warming up to the movie, rather it just felt pretty busy from the get go. But also a good thing, since this just adds to the uneasiness of the movie, which I felt during the whole movie, I hope this was their goal, because they did a good job. However, the movie felt too “cinematic”. The quality was crystal clear, some parts felt acted, and music filled the entirety of the movie. I felt like I was watching a movie, instead of experiencing this film. Amazing job, and a good watch",joker
"Joker is a flawless film in every sense. It tells an extraordinary story and presents a character arc that is nothing short of mesmerizing. The execution is impeccable, drawing the audience into a whirlwind of emotions. Every moment feels meticulously crafted, making it, without question, a masterclass in cinema.",joker
"Joker (2019) is a powerful and intense film that takes us deep into the troubled mind of Arthur Fleck, brilliantly played by Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix’s performance is nothing short of mesmerizing and easily deserves the Oscar he won. The movie keeps you on edge, slowly building tension as it shows Fleck’s transformation into the Joker. The character development is impressive, making Fleck’s journey feel real and tragic. The film also does a great job of showing how society’s neglect can push someone to the edge. Visually, Joker stands out with its dark, gritty background contrasted by flashes of color, symbolizing Fleck’s rare moments of joy, mostly through his unsettling laughter. Overall, Joker is a chilling and unforgettable experience. It gives us a version a version of the Joker that feels authentic and human, not just a comic book villain. Phoenix’s performance and the film’s striking visuals leave a lasting impact.",joker
The details in this film is amazing. If you are a person who notice the details ..you will love this film.details in acting .. enviroment..everything is so good.,joker
"While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a terrific performance, the movie itself falls a bit short for me. I found the twist to be very predictable. It also feels as though they shoehorned this story into the DC Universe. I will say, however, that the final half hour or so of this film is tremendous and there are some truly iconic shots from a cinematography standpoint.",joker
"Hernan David chaparro A raw portrait of loneliness and mental illness. Joaquin Phoenix’s performance is powerful and unforgettable. The story is dark, uncomfortable, and realistic. It shows how society can destroy a person. Not an action movie, but a social reflection",joker
"I normally don't like movies that focus on clear cut villains, but the WHY is interesting and the acting is well done and the score and the scenery are haunting as is fitting for the film. However I would not have added anything remotely related to Batman in the movie.",joker
"This dramatic thriller it's not a classic cinecomic but a history of mental decline with disastrous consequences. The social complaint is strong, as the extraordinary evidence of Joaquin Phoenix.",joker
"I was initially nervous to watch this since I knew from other joker movies there's needless violence. While of course there was violence, It served in artistic purpose. What finally convinced me to watch was seeing Joker 2. Now that I can compare, I would say they're both equally good. My heart was racing. I feel like it also touches on some contemporary issues, which reminds me of The People's joker in that regard. I also don't want to live in New York City because of this lol.",joker
"Probably one of the smartest and eye opening films I've ever seen, this movie doesn't do much for visuals or things movies usually do. But this movie left me feeling overjoyed coming out of the theater, but I also felt new and refreshed. Everything felt fascinating and new, and everything was fresh. This movie was incredible, and this is a gem since I find that movies are not made this special anymore. This movie is special, and It should be treated as such",joker
"Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor and this movie proves it. Although it seems to have a somewhat pessimistic story, it is important to remember that this is just Arthur's reality.",joker
"I've already watched the movie multiple times. It's a blast each time for the atmosphere and the images of a dark Gotham alone. To me, it's utterly impossible to understand how anyone would rate the movie negatively. I understand that it might disappoint viewers' expectations, especially if they're expecting a regular action-flick. Once you understand, the movie lives and breathes for the psychology of its main character and the gloomy depiction of city as a dog-eat-dog uncaring world, you are open to the greatness of this absolute masterpiece. There is no scene and no sentence without meaning and deeper message. Maybe one has to rewatch it after a first disappointment in order to fully appreciate its genius.",joker
"*Rough Thoughts* 95% A cautionary tale of metal health The factors that play the state not giving a damn about people with mental disorders, and of course his own accountability and then what happened to him.

"Joker is a gritty, intense character study that dives deep into the psyche of Arthur Fleck. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a mesmerizing performance that’s both heartbreaking and disturbing. The cinematography, score, and direction all add to the film’s heavy, unsettling tone. While it’s not an easy watch and can be uncomfortable at times, it’s a bold, artistic take on a familiar villain that lingers in your mind. A must-see for fans of psychological drama.",joker
"Joker explores the central character's gradual descent into madness. Initially, he is depicted as awkward and downtrodden, struggling to find his place in a society that seems set on marginalizing him. As circumstances and personal afflictions beyond his control continue piling up, he becomes increasingly unhinged, ultimately giving way to the chaos and anarchy that defines his character. The film's realistic approach to the making of the most famous - or perhaps infamous - madman in comic book history is both unsettling and haunting.",joker
"The joker is a solemn and depressing movie and completely crushing to the human spirit. The movie is a level above any other modern superhero movie creating a more down to earth and possible narrative. Mental illness, depression and the government’s lack of attention to this sector of healthcare is a prevalent issue in this movie creating the perfect blend of emotions giving the audience a deep understanding of Arthur fleck and his slow decent into madness only excelled by the writing and performance from Joaquin phoenix truly showing the darker side of society and how unbalanced life’s hand can be.",joker
"A movie full of violence, joking about suicide, showing killing parents, close friends and his own idol. Joachim Phoenix doesn't look or act like a great character, the thing he does right is to embody fully the mental illness. The Joker character in DC comics is certainly twisted and dangerous, but he is not a weakling that everyone downgrades. The movie is mostly about someone hopeless that just always go deeper in sadness and madness. I tried to watch it in full in several times, because some friends told me it was great, but I fail to see in what it's great, it's just sad and dark. Mental illness is not something to joke with or push deeper. It's like the full plot of the movie is to find reasons to justify that someones becomes a criminal, which is really twisted as well...! Insane and trash.",joker
"When this movie was in theatre's my circle of friends were hyped to go see it. I ended up going with a buddy and loved every minute. It's gripping. It's tells a tale of a kind hearted man being down trodden by society and Joaquin pheonix plays the role perfectly. A week After another buddy asked me to go see it again. I was like, hell it's worth the money and rewatch. Still amazing. This movie hits you emotionally and doesn't let go from the start. 2 days later the wife gets mad I've gone and seen it twice without her. So I go a 3rd time. This is the only movie I've gone and seen it 3 times during being in theatres. I'll say this is my number 1 in terms of movies with no hesitation.",joker
"It's very rare I rewatch movies, especially ones made within the last 25+ years; but this one was a masterpiece I had to. The story, acting, emotion, all make you relate to Arthur. Things you've felt and wanted to do but they were too extreme to actually to do them. This is the best DC Comics movie ever made to date.",joker
"This movie was fantastic! I love how it did not feel like a comic-book movie at all. The whole story felt shockingly real, which made the film so much better. This is definitely one of the best superhero spin-off movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it!",joker
"Joker es un personaje que ha perdurado bastante en el tiempo desde su aparición en los comics hasta trascender en diferentes medios como películas y dibujos animados. Lo cierto es que este personaje se ha vuelto uno de los más populares marcando la cultura popular. Hacer una película sobre él iba a ser algo dudoso, pero terminaron haciendo una película muy prometedora con un estilo del Hollywood clásico. Joker ha tenido diferentes versiones y diferentes orígenes que no son muy claros cuál es el auténtico. El mismo Joker no tiene recuerdos de su propio pasado, así que hay muchas posibilidades. Aquí decidieron hacer una historia de origen mucho más realista, con un Joker bastante humano y con una interesante crítica social que cuestiona la moral establecida por la sociedad. Joaquin Phoenix brinda una asombrosa actuación encarnando un Joker bastante trágico. Aquí el icónico villano es alguien lleno de dolor que vive en una ciudad donde no hay sentido de justicia y los menos afortunados son los que sufren más. Joker, bajo la identidad de Arthur, es alguien que vive en los sectores bajos y que sufre problemas debido a la inestabilidad social. Al inicio es asaltado, luego es despedido injustamente y cuando tiene la oportunidad de defenderse de otros asaltantes sus acciones son consideradas un crimen contra la sociedad. Es peor cuando Arthur va descubriendo la verdad sobre su madre y sobre las figuras que él consideraba ideales como Thomas Wayne y Murray Franklin. Arthur se convierte en una bomba a punto de estallar y al perder acceso a los medicamentos que lo mantenían estable por culpa del recorte, Arthur va perdiendo el control. Se puede concluir que Joker es una víctima de las circunstancias y la poca atención de una sociedad injusta ha impedido que él obtuviera la ayuda que necesitaba para no convertirse en un psicópata. Arthur se da cuenta de que está viviendo en una sociedad injusta donde a nadie le importa su dolor y por eso decide dejar salir su lado más salvaje. Si bien Joker puede parecer un psicópata, todo lo que sucede a su alrededor demuestra que él tiene razón. A veces la gente se deja llevar tanto por la idea de lo bueno y lo malo implantado por la sociedad, que no se toman la molestia de plantearse si todo en la sociedad está bien. El detonante es cuando Joker acaba con la vida de tres empleados de Wayne Enterprises que lo han atacado y las noticias retratan a estas personas como víctimas. Eso hace que Joker quede pintado como un vilano, pero gana apoyo por parte de los menos afortunados. Ciudad Gótica tiene un serio problema económico y vemos como la gente harta de su situación actual decide recurrir a la violencia, inspirados por Joker. Tiene sentido porque de qué sirve respetar el orden en una sociedad donde no hay justicia para los más desafortunados. Las acciones de Joker contra sus asaltantes son vistas como algo malo, pero nadie sabe lo que ha pasado realmente. La realidad es que no se sabe a ciencia cierta si la víctima de un asesinato fue alguien realmente inocente, porque detrás de un crimen hay una razón. Si es por algo que la víctima hizo para dañar de cualquier forma a su futuro victimario, entonces el crimen está justificado. Las acciones de Joker están justificadas, si se deja de lado la moral. Muchas veces alguien comete un crimen contra la sociedad debido a que la sociedad lo trato injustamente o nadie respondió el grito de auxilio del individuo cuando más lo necesitaba. Eso justifica bastante las acciones de alguien, por más que la sociedad lo vea como algo malo. Analizando el paradigma completo, la verdad es que no existe tal cosa como lo bueno y lo malo y tampoco la persona inocente como tal. Si las acciones de Joker fueran algo totalmente repudiable, no hubiese tenido apoyo de los manifestantes. Así que si un psicópata comete tales actos porque al ver su historial se descubre que no ha tenido un trato justo por parte de la sociedad, entonces esa persona tiene razón en hacer lo que hace. Si el ser humano como tal nace con la capacidad de hacer lo inenarrable, entonces la sociedad misma es quien lo forja y lo corrompe de forma directa o indirecta. La misma sociedad es la que crea a sus monstruos. Joker termina siendo una excelente historia de origen, desarrollando su trasfondo psicológico y haciendo que podamos entender sus acciones. No es una película de acción, pero es un gran drama psicológico con una buena historia que explica como Ciudad Gótica fue invadida por el crimen antes de la llegada de Batman. Una sociedad inestable da origen a una ola de crimen insostenible. No se sabe si Thomas Wayne era un hombre humilde, pero Bruce demostró ser mejor al no recurrir a métodos extremos cuando se convirtió en Batman. Aunque sea una historia independiente sin relación con el universo cinematográfico de DC, Joker logra ser una de las mejores películas de DC Comics que nos ha brindado una de las mejores versiones de este icónico villano. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10.",joker
"I found it a terribly disturbing and shockingly violent movie, which left me with a feeling of distress. Yes, it did properly convey the sad story of a psychologically troubled man struggling with the injustice in society, but for me it didn't make up for the negativity in this movie. However, I can see how people appreciate Arthur's character development and value the narrative in which society is subjected to a critical examination.",joker
"This movie is why I no longer listen to ""professional"" critics. The stuff the media put out delayed my watch of this movie. An absolute shame, because this movie was 👏 amazing. Yes, it paints the Joker in a sympathetic light, but this isn't a batman movie. It's a Joker movie. And an absolutely great, 💯 must watch movie, at that. 👍 👍 It tackles real issues, such as poverty, and how we, as a society, treat those suffering mental illness. It's not your main stream comic book villian. It's about a man tormented on the outside, by society, and the inside, his own mind. This movie is a beautiful interpretation of this character, that turns insanity into art and destruction.",joker
"A divisive film that I can say, with certainty as of posting, is one of my favorite movies of all time. I won't delve into the sensitive subjects that this movie encircles. But... It is beautifully shot, with thoughtful design and a near-perfect final look for Joker. Wonderfully acted with this being one of Joaquin's top 3 performances. And flawlessly scored, with Hildur Guðnadóttir immediately joining my Apple Music playlist. Melancholy and beautifully haunting. Don't miss this one.",joker
"It's a very thorough and independent origin, the worldview is very good, and it's the most exciting R-rated work I've ever seen! ! The idea of ​​gradually becoming the Joker is great! ! This was the most interesting DC work! ! P.S.: No need for the second game.",joker
"Upon rewatch, it definitely doesn't work as well. The messaging feels a little too on-the-nose from time to time and its concepts aren't all that original. Yet, 'Joker' still raises some powerful questions about the abusive nature of society and how it can harm those around us, and the film serves as a game-changer for how a Comic-Book film can be portrayed. Also, Joaquin Phoenix's performance still hits. Messy, but compelling.",joker
"Based on the failed career origin, offers a unique presentation on a pitiful Joker in development, Phoenix at his best. Though I argue greatly with the ethics /morality of his ""misdoings,"" at very least it's a thrill. Messy, fabulous comparing to Ledger, Nicholson, even Romaro--sry Leto, but you sucked--definitely a joy to watch, pity about the second....",joker
"Not so much Joker, more of a social film than an antihero. Joaquin in a terrific performance in a Joker movie alongside Jack and Heath. But in a different role.",joker
"This movie is extremely dark but also breathtaking. Joaquin Phoenix performed one of his greatest roles of all time and absolutely crushed it as Joker, almost just as good as Heath Ledgers Joker ever so slightly. And I definitely believe that this is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time, please go watch it! :)",joker
"I'd give Joker 5 out of 5 stars. It's a movie that will leave you questioning the very fabric of society and wondering if we're all just one bad day away from becoming the Joker. Or at least, that's what I'm telling myself.",joker
Amazing film. Beautifully retold the classic story of the infamous joker. Very relatable. You have to see it. one of the best films ever created. It is almost as good as even the legendary dark knight for best DC film. It honestly makes you feel bad for such a so-called evil person.,joker
"The movie was a masterpiece, and I recommend this movie those who has hard time with your works. Kill the rich was an good idea",joker
"I detest lame and predictable superhero movies, but this is one fabulously made film, skilfully directed, superbly lit and well staged. Joaquin Phoenix is brooding throughout and is both mesmerising and believable - you never know what is coming next. He thoroughly deserves his acting awards. Absolutely superb.",joker
"A mesmerizing, well put together Joker movie that exceeded my expectations by far! Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker was amazing and puts such a creepy, twisted look into the character that applies so much intrigue. It makes you uncomfortable (this is a compliment) and makes you really care and look at these mental illnesses differently. It’s hard to take your eyes off of the screen with how the movie looks visually which adds a sense of differentiation from other comic book movies that look dull and uninspired a lot of the time. Overall it really works in so many ways and I’m happy that they took the risk to give Joker his own film. 8/10",joker
"This movie is the greatest movie I have ever seen. Joaquin Phoenix's acting job is the greatest I have ever seen, the movie is a thrill ride and leaves you wanting more. It is extremely entertaining and has something to say about the way we treat each other and think about mentally ill people. I disagree with the opinion that this film glorifies violence as Arthur uses it not for entertainment but rather as a way to gain what he wants most, attention. If he had another way to get it he would definitely do so.",joker
No plot. No character development. Boring. Producers thought they had a gold mine getting GaGa. She was great as always but the film is her ball and chain. Barf.,joker
"A must see. Exceptional building of character and back story, one of the greatest acting performances I’ve seen put on by Joaquin Phoenix, incredible soundtrack. A modern masterpiece",joker
"Thought-invoking, dark, and addictive. Joaquin played a very different version of a character we all love. As the Joker's history/origin has changed throughout DC, with many comics citing his life as a mystery, this film did add its own spice to a complex character. It provided a more realistic view of someone having a few too many ""bad days"". Loved this film. Actors were fantastic as well.",joker
"I loved this new telling of THE JOKER. It was dark, mysterious, exiting and emotional. I was really pleased with this film when I saw it. The makeup and costume design is exceptional. I loved the stairs dance and everything about Arthur Fleck’s story. Overall, a good film.",joker
"Super good movie about jokers back story and I recommended to all, but if your not comfortable with bloody seances and foul language this won't be a good pick for you. If you do like those things (or just don't care) I 1,000% recommend this movie. 5/5!",joker
"A genius movie, the most interesting origin I've seen in recent years. The cast is crazy, the plot is good and engrossing, Joaquin Phoenix's acting is really good and really like a diamond. This is a once in a lifetime movie.",joker
"This movie doesn't even come close to the Joker of The Dark Knight. This movie is just a movie on the mental health of a person. If I watch a movie on the mental health of this person then this movie is okay, it is good. but This is Not Joker",joker
"It was a quality movie, the Joker's performance was superb. It was a movie completely similar to Joker. It was a very high quality movie and definitely worth watching.",joker
"This film simply showed a huge middle finger to all expensive blockbusters. Joker is a very dark, very heavy, very telling film that carefully swings between mass appeal and arthouse. A film where the main villain is society and madness follows a chain from the political system to the economy to the economy to the mentality. People become poor, angry, aggressive and God forbid Arthur comes under this hand, because if a clown becomes a symbol of the Rebellion, then isn't this true madness? A down-to-earth and gloomy Goth, oppressive music and at the head of all this villain, Joaquin Phoenix, is certainly the main advantage of the film. This is a benefit performance of an actor who, it seems, as in life, was not particularly friendly with reason, but here he gives a complex, multi-layered and truly scary image. But although how much can you crucify about what a strong film this is? Joker made such a strong resonance and renaissance in the superhero movie genre that it brought the main prize of the Venice Film Festival and a billion dollars to Warner Bros., thereby becoming the highest-grossing R-rated film in the history of cinema. And Joker certainly became the brightest film of 2019 and absolutely deserved it. It is even now one of my favorite films.",joker
"This movie is a work of art. Tough, and dramatical, it portrays a great and deep story. Phoenix's acting is perfect. Soundtrack is iconic and memorable. The sequel is a complete waste of time, but this movie is one in a million.",joker
"Joker shows exactly what a dystopian society can do to a man when he is always pushed down for his entire life. It is an amazing film. Sadly, I can’t say the same about its sequel.",joker
"Just brilliant. One of my favourite films now, fantastic acting, fantastic story line, fantastic cinematography.. it’s such a deep, emotional story line that grasps you from the start.",joker
"I understand the movie intends to shine a light on what’s going on with mental health, and how individuals upbringing lead to problems in the adult life that not only affect the person who’s dealing with these issues but also affects the society. I understand as well that this is kind of an attempt of mixing a fictional character with a human being. That purpose alone works, at least for me, I was very happy with the way most of the movie unfolded. But…I also acknowledge that by doing so—trying to humanize a fictional character—this movie also shows clearly what being a white man means. It’s obvious for the viewer, if you have common sense, that what happens in the film happens because the character is white and a man. That being said, Joaquin performance is brilliant. The pace was great I just wish there was a little more development of Joker phase. Other than that I think it is a piece of art.",joker
"The acting is superb and the music is well chosen and great,it is a compelling movie and I'm not even sure if I liked it ! If that is strange to you then I suggest you see it.....and you will see what I mean,I could watch it again.",joker
"In this movie you watch the descent of a man's mind. This is terrifying, because you realize that you may not be so different from Arthur Fleck and causes you to question just how society has changed you in ways out of your control.",joker
October 2019 - I realized while I was editing the review video that it was going to be a bit longer than intended. So I created an abbreviated version in addition to a full/long version (where I went into more detailed analysis of various subject matter/themes/etc.). The full one is a little rambling but there was SO much subject matter to process and talk about! There are spoilers - not major ones though. Sorry for the audio volume issue around the 7-minute mark. I must have accidentally missed bumping the volume for that particular clip. My abbreviated review video is here (~13 minutes) :  My full review video is here (~33 minutes): ,joker
"É arrastado em alguns pontos, mas tem uma boa história, e uma atuação matadora de Joaquin Phoenix, o visual à la Martin Scorsese, e as homenagens à versões anteriores do Coringa. Fazem a assistida valerem muito à pena!",joker
"This is an amazing take on the Joker's origin story. Some may say that it isn't really a Joker movie and is basically just a random bloke called Arthur Fleck masquerading as the Joker, but the way I see it, it is. The Joker's philosophy is that all it takes to become like him is one bad day. This movie basically embodies that philosophy. All it took Arthur to begin the path to becoming the Clown Prince of Crime was one bad day where he got fired from his job and beaten up by 3 people on the subway. It fits the character well. Even if Joker 2 takes the plot in a very different (and still good) direction, this movie still holds up as an amazing Joker origin story.",joker
"Joker - 10/10. Masterpiece. I don't like calling films masterpieces or incredible very often, but I also can't get this film out of my head since I watched it. Joker is one of those movies that sticks with you. For what it was trying to do (creating a serious drama driven comic book film), the film passes with flying colours. First and foremost, this is NOT a movie for everyone. It's rated R for a reason, and it's subject matter and the manner that the film progresses quite possibly be off putting for some people. It's a harrowing experience to see how Arthur Fleck lives from the beginning of the film, and it is also deeply disturbing how he transforms from a depressed outcast to becoming a horrible and maniacal villain. Joaquin Phoenix takes what Heath Ledger brought to the character in The Dark Knight, and creates a different look for the character. You progress from feeling bad for the guy to becoming genuinely terrified of what he will do/think next. Joaquin does an amazing job of creating the journey of Arthur with just subtle changes to his body language and delivery of dialogue from scene to scene. Todd Phillips does a spectacular job of reinventing his visual and story telling methods (even with the obvious nods to previous Martin Scorsese films). The cinematography is incredible and the music is haunting. It's a film that holds your attention and refuses to let go. Probably the best film of the year and one of the best of this decade! Well done!",joker
A masterpiece of a show to be honest. Every single scene is oscar worthy and the acting is out of this world. Flawless movie that everyone should see,joker
"I absolutely loved this film As a joker & Batman fan & as a admirer of the silver screen, I very much enjoyed this film. The music, lighting, cinematography and of course the acting and story was phenomenal. It totally blew our minds when watching this is the cinema when it came out.",joker
Joker movie? The Joke on Us! One of the worse movies I’ve seen in the last ten years! I struggled to stay focus on the movie and at times I found myself falling asleep. Bad movie all the way around!,joker
"Shut it off after ca. 15 minutes. Unwatchable. The Joker is here a miserable, highly dysfunctional wreck of a man, a complete loser without any trace of the traits that make the actual Joker interesting, entertaining and even relevant as a super-villain. A horrendous screenplay and primitive, formulaic, thoughtless, vastly overplayed characterisation by Phoenix make this an actively irritating experience.",joker
"Joker 2019 is possibly one of the best films I’ve ever seen. It has such a good message being that you should never keep on making fun of someone, because as joker quotes ( “ Nobody Knows What It’s Like To Be The Other Guy”) It may have a dark message but guess what “ That's life “",joker
"A well made movie, but far from a masterpiece. It's enjoyable in its' own right, but it feels incredibly derivative of film's past from other celebrated directors.",joker
"Absolutely brilliant. One of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The character development, story, realism, gritty/dark tones really resonate and make this film dazzling. Highly recommend watching this masterpiece.",joker
"""Joker (2019) is one of my favorite movies, and the Joker is my favorite comic book character. It has a compelling story, and while the character is undoubtedly disturbed and insane, you can't help but root for him. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is phenomenal and has solidified his place as one of my top 10 actors of all time. The best part of the movie, though, is undoubtedly Garry!""",joker
"I felt compelled by all the media reports saying this movie is terrible to write a review. It's a good movie!! The first was better but not by much, the musical element adds a nice additional way to allow the protagonists to communicate what they are feeling. Nice little two-face Easter egg at the end scene too. Joaquin is brilliant, as is Gaga. Moving study of mental health from various angles. Really enjoyed it and so did my girlfriend.",joker
I thought it was great. Don’t get all the hate towards it. The scene where Joker represents himself in court goes a little overboard and maybe there could have been a couple less songs. But all in all a unique masterpiece. Everyone gives the Marvel movies (which I tend to love) great reviews when their stories are all the same formula but make a movie with a more original or dark take? God forbid!! It’s not the best movie I’ve ever seen but very much worth a watch. Don’t let any of the bad reviews stop you from watching it and making your own mind up. It’s unique enough to least deserve a viewing.,joker
"If I could give them ""Zero Stars"" I would and Will Not Recommend it; This movie was horrible, for someone with Mental Illness that was labeled a troubled child, probably bullied, verbally, physically abused, then was tormented to death. I hate I paid my money to see this movie, I was completely disturbed.",joker
"If youve never seen the King of Comedy, fight club, Batman or Taxi Driver you may enjoy it. If you enjoy the previously mentioned, just go watch those and not this.",joker
"Что я ждал от Джокера 2. Кстати нашумевшый и обожаемый вами Джокер часть 1 тоже полное дерьмо. (Извините что так резок). Я не знал и не узнаю похоже лучшего ""Джокера"", чем Джокер Хита Леджера. А я даже надеялся что этот Джокер будет лучше чем 1ая часть. Но он оказался даже хуже. Сплошное разочарование. ДС пора уже сворачивать и остановить перевыпуск новых Джокеров пока не найдут такого же таланта как Хит Леджер. Вот такого Джокера я бы с удовольствием посмотрел бы. Всем мира и добра!",joker
"this movie was disturbing, and very gritty and grim. it was a very believable in and outside the DC universe as a joker origin story. it was BEAUTIFULLY put together with some of the best cinematography I have seen, and a very good soundtrack to compliment the story. it was very immersive in showing how a misunderstood man became a violent monster in an inequitable society. 9/10",joker
"An instant cult-classic, and homage to Taxi Driver. This was a well crafted film that captured raw emotion, and put it on the screen in a package that delivered what you want.",joker
"The best way to screw up a legendary character, adding a shitty musical and making a character with a lot of evil and character look weak.",joker
"It's a really good Movie. In other movies, you see Joker as a psychopath but you never knew why. In this movies you really know how Arthur Fleck is gonna turn as the Joker. The acting of Joaquin Phoenix was really phenomenal.",joker
"Another movie I don't understand why it's so popular. Just a miserable, awful and disturbing film. Well acted and paced nicely, but uncomfortable throughout. No reason to make a film like this other than to shock people. I can't imagine anyone watching this film more than once.",joker
"Simply put, this is a phenomenal movie. Delve into the life of an outcast and start to feel empathy for his destructive behaviours. This movie may just have you rooting for the villain by highlighting negative personal circumstances and trauma endured by Arthur Fleck. Additionally, the role of the greater society in crime and mental illness is brought to light.",joker
"Very sad movie with horrible consequences for society, excellent story of a poor, ignored, and isolated man. The scene in the stairwell full of self-discovery was a most haunting time and place for a disturbed mind. Absolutely horrible, just terrible. The birth of a dangerous man, a story told with great depth, a great work of art.",joker
"Wow - have to admit that Phenix is a outstanding actor - but if you are not a fan of musicals this film is really bad and boring... If i didn't have to stay - i would have walked out after 5, 10 or 15 minutes",joker
"I think the movies actually takes one, between what's real and what's nto real in the jokers head. I did enjoy the movie really good for me. Yet it was a little too musical for me, not sure it's what I enjoy in such a movie.",joker
Loved this movie so much when it came out shows the dark truth about the society we live in. Very much recommend for anyone who likes deep movies.,joker
This is a stylistically brilliant film with a strong plot and fantastic character development. Plus any film with Frank Sinatra playing is bound to be good.,joker
"The ‘Joker’ movie shows how most people put on ‘masks’ to hide they’re mental illness to fit in with society so they don’t get rejected. It also shows the side affects of somebody who has been kicked out of society and therefore feels the need to rebel, when Joker says the line ''If it was me dying on the sidewalk you’d walk right over me'' which implies the fact that the 3 guys were favoured because they were richer and thats why people care so much. This relates to the real world because in most cases the people with the most money get treated and recognized more, also in Gotham at that time most of the people thats would’ve been labeled poor felt this way and thats why when Arthur decided to stand up for himself the rest felt obligated to do so. This movie gives perspective to people maybe dealing or suffering with a mental illness or poor mental health, it gives viewers a look inside what that persons life is like or how much they have to deal with. There is one scene on the bus when Arthur is making a child smile and the mother tells him to stop bothering her child and he starts laughing because when he’s under pressure he can’t help but laugh from head damage he obtained as a child, he gives her a card explaining his condition but she justs looks at him like he’s crazy. This makes the audience feel sympathy and sadness towards Arthur but there is also a realisation that this is a real life situation and when people admit to having a mental illness or a mental health condition we just stereotype them and label them crazy or insane. People hate murders and killers but we are the ones who create them, we label people fucking insane and call them a lost cause. Now im not justifying murder here but were partially to blame for living in this fucked up society which we always complain about. But no, it always someone elses fault never our own, everybody wears they’re own mask when they’re really dying on the inside.",joker
"Joker (2019) is my Favourite Standalone DC Film of all time. Joaquin Phoenix's Performance was actually crazy and blow up my mind and this is what making this film became populer. Overall Presentation, Setting, Screenplay, Todd Philips's Direction and ""Beautiful and Unforgettable"" Orchestra Soundtrack all is Masterpiece. My Favourite to Watch!!!",joker
The approach of the sequel is indeed very different. Strong acting performance. Complex/layered. Its hard to say what to improve. The more I think about the différent scenes the more I like it.,joker
"Joker isn’t just an awesome comic book movie, it’s an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix’s fully committed performance and Todd Phillips’ masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.",joker
"After watch the sequel l, first film is ruined and unwatchable now, used to be 4 star, but now unwatchable and sold my blu ray too.",joker
"Joker 2 alternative theories: Was Harleen a honey trap? Did anyone consider the potential for deceit, when the bully guard (Played by Brendan Gleeson), in an uncharacteristic kind act, effectively takes Arthur to meet Harleen (Lee) at the choir? As the film progresses, we find out from Arthur's Lawyer who Harleen really is. Did she lure him in with him with a false personal story or do they really have a connection, a Folie a Deux? Arthur questions Harleen who further reels him. Arthur then ignores his lawyer's motherly warning. At this point he totally smitten with Harleen. In my opinion Arthur's lawyer was the only character who genuinely cared for him. She was wise to the institution harm at Arkham: she understood the neglect and torture that was inflicted on Arthur by the guards, and psychological torment belitting him, e.g., they mock how easy he was to catch, through his unstrategic crime to kill someone live on TV. Arthur's lawyers pleads insanity and builds a defense case highlighting his abusive childhood, to help him avoid the death sentence. It was Harleen that drove the wedge between them. Ultimately Arthur fires his lawyer and represents himself dressed as the joker. He talk about folie! Harleen being a honey trap would also explain how she manages to bend the rules of the prison regime over and over again. For example gaining private access to his cell where the films' sex takes place (its depiction is the antithesis of porn: bleak and over in a flash). The only problematic scene would be the fire during the movie night at Arkham. If Harleen was really working as some kind of undercover agent, then would it be plausible for her to go that far to destroy property? It was a reckless move but it paid off in gaining Arthur's trust. On reflection it was another example of her managing to evade consequence to her actions and instead is released from the jail. Ultimately Lee breaks up with him, at the very moment that their fantasy to live together as a family could have become true. She appears to be disappointed in him, for taking an unprecedented move to admit in the court room that he's not mentally ill. But I think that was exactly what she wanted to happen. I think she was a honey trap, planted whether working alone or undercover in cahoots with New York state and her doctor father, on a mission to lead him to Arthur to his demise. I think sabotage Arthur's chances of winning his freedom during the trial: the State of New York versus Arthur Fleck.",joker
"The joker two was a continuing story of Arthur and his struggle with his mental health and his desire for Granger. The movie is a continuance of the beginning and right after the sequences of the first and have to deal with the repercussions in being in jail, very realistic and grimy, jail scenes played a lot into his relationship with the guards finding Harley Quinn through their intervention. Lady Gaga did very well as Harley Quinn showing her own side of madness and drawing out Arthur’s madness with her obsession of the joker, hoping to bring it out and keep it out.Music sequences were very well thought dancing joker was a delight to see the movie can tear you down if you know the reality of prison and duality mental health where one can bring down the other I give this movie five out of five stars, as the continued story of Arthur the Joker",joker
"""I love this movie, I think it’s brilliant and not only Todd Phillips' best film but it’s exciting because it’s on a frontier. And that’s usually where very good things happen. Todd and Scott Silver’s screenplay has that relevance that occurs when work is authentic and not derivative. We find Arthur disturbing and poignant simultaneously. He’s both child victim and adult perpetrator. Both are true, as is the case with most schizophrenics. That both are true is uncomfortable. We find ourselves in a fugue state. It’s counterpoint. It’s why Arthur and the film’s impact sustains so strongly in memory. To build on all of this, and for Joaquin Phoenix, Todd, and Scott, to impact upon on this powerfully is a difficult accomplishment."" - Michael Mann Hard to argue with one the greatest filmmakers ever.",joker
"This movie slogged along so slowly it was painful. And the fact that it ran 2:19 made it even worse. The acting was passable, but I had hoped for much more.",joker
"Although Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job of portraying the writer and directors vision of the Joker, I believe the idea of the Joker has been too Humanized. Heath Ledgers Portrayal of the Joker brought us up to the level that could be considered human, just the right balance, in the world of super humans. Fast forward to Jared Leto's Joker in suicide squad and hes a gangster with gold chains and tattoos, Overly humanized. This movie obviously tries to introduce the Joker as just a regular guy, twisted by his upbringing and the lack of respect from the outside world. Yet, it fails to depict the Joker as the brilliant evil genius that he is. In comics and other movie sources it is made clear that the entity known as the Joker has never been diagnosed with any mental illness because of how he can manipulate the therapists trying to label him. In front of one therapists he will portray himself as a cool and calculated sociopath, to another a manic depressive with suicidal tendencies, to another a hysterical, maniacal person completely lacking control of his emotions or a cold blooded Psycopath. It was this skill of manipulation after all, that turned Harlene Quinzel into Harley Quin, the Jokers protege. So, great acting throughout the movie, unfortunately failing due to the script missing the essence of The Joker.",joker
"When I watched this movie when it came out, it wasn’t my favorite because I have never been the biggest joker fan. Rewatching the movie I can say I do like it a little more than I did. I think he did a great job playing joker in the film.",joker
"Outside of Phoenix delivering a stellar performance, earning that oscar for sure, there is nothing about this movie that was good - It takes 30 minutes of dullness before something remotely interesting happens and then it takes another hour of dullness for the movie to finally figure out an ending - Not a good ending at all, but at least an ending. Phoenix was the only bright part of this movie and im amazed at how he got away with such a performance with such a boring ass story. The cinematography wasnt even good, tho the audio was decent. The trailers are a better bang for your buck for sure. This movie is 2 hours, but it feels like it 3½, thats how boring it is",joker
"Massively overrated. I find Pheonix quite cringey to be honest but I’m sure it appeals to many kids that feel isolated because they spend far too much time online playing fantasy games and have become bitter to reality but hey, get out more and live.",joker
"I was never able to see Joker until now thanks for streaming 😊 I did watch it in parts because my attention span is a size of a pea lol. But omg what a movie. It really depicts the need for increase social services, city improvement and stigma on mental health. It was a movie describing the joker the one we see behind Batman. Joaquin Phoenix brilliant he deserved the award for best Oscar. I want to see the second one but I am going to ignore the critics. I love lady Gaga and thinks this role was for her",joker
"Una obra maestra que demuestra el efecto de las circunstancias sociales y familiares en la psicología de una persona, dándole al famoso villano de Batman una nueva perspectiva que permite comprender las circunstancias que rodearon su historia y origen.",joker
"Amazing movie! You must watch this movie. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is great. The time flies by, and by the end of the movie, you end up wanting more. I recommend it to friends and they love it too",joker
"This is a Masterpiece! Wuao , It's not a simple villain and superhero movie, it's the world inside the head of a mentally ill person. I LOVED IT. ART",joker
"You must see!!! If you know anything about Deluded Narcissistic behavior you know that Arthur Fleck checks out every time he has to do something he doesn’t want. This time Lady Gaga steps into the scene and tells him to stop taking his meds. It’s on. There are 3 women in his life he hears mother’s voice, lawyer wants to save his life, and Harley Gaga wants him as Joker. . They are all controlling him. The music and dancing is nostalgic and moves into the evolution of his new relationship. Loved it!!!!! Love Joaquin amazing performance favorite scene was the shave scene. Soundtrack is on point.",joker
"Arthur is the ultimate joker, an unreliable narrator with a fractured mind, his story told through inventive camera angles and Edward Hopper lighting. His mind dances unravelled through an atmospheric score and underlining lyrics of popular songs, as events that might have happened unfold before us, horrific, darkly humorous, clues to his background scattered like the detritus of a ransacked room. Phoenix gives us as much nuance as we can stand, colouring in right up to the corners, his physicality informing us as much as his words, earning every accolade he received for this. Joker does not conform to the standard fare of comic-inspired film, concentrating on a tiny corner of a dirty laundry basket rather than any kind of wide redemptive or narrative arc. It is not joyful or predictable, but it does leave a lasting impression of a truly troubled mind told in an intriguing way and is a significant contribution to the comic-book oeuvre",joker
"After watching Joker 2 it made me realize even more how I should have appreciated this movie before. This had it all, the action, the drama, the mental illness of Joker. It was PERFECT. Sucks that Todd decided to then go on and make a part 2 but instead of just making the second one even better he did the complete opposite, he had 200m to play with, made a musical out of it that had no goal/ hook to it and then glazed it by saying how good will it be.",joker
"Superb movie. It’s great to see that villains are not one dimensional (if this is the Joker character in Batman) and that there is always a good reason for why they become the way they become. The portrayal of the character by Jacqueline Phoenix is phenomenal. Had to watch it again and was just as intense as the first time. Music, camera angles, lighting, editing: top class.",joker
"Just a delicate film, I could feel him breaking, the emptiness inside, the sense of being lost, what’s real anymore. The musical masterpieces is where he hides or trying to make sense of it all. Slowly realising he’s not the joker, it’s as if the film itself is a mad man. Chaotic, theatrical, Romantic heartbreaking and ultimately so sad. So many emotions, So much pain and agony. And yet it’s all Just one big show. The one thing I noticed about Arthur is in both films he’s going through life with everyone around him has in-control of his life of his every move, the only time he ever took control is when he put on the show and became the joker. There is an arthur fleck in all of us!",joker
"Joaquin Phoenix as Joker along with Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn were a tour de force with mind blowing chemistry. Joaquin does heartbreaking, evil while making us adore him. As Lady Gaga bares all she serves the a genius foil to Joker. The films musical score (Oscar worthy,) brings us one the many unique film experiences of the year, bravo.",joker
"A near-perfect masterpiece of story-telling when it comes to the villain's side of things/origin of a man who's thrown into a society that never cared about him until he actually put on an act for the world as the ""Joker"".",joker
"The first Joker is a masterclass in acting, directing, cinematography and storytelling. Every scene and moment adds to the bigger picture as it moves towards its climatic end.",joker
"This movie is one of the best movies I've ever watched and sometimes I don't know what critics actually want from a movie.It's like one day, they choose to acclaim a terrible movie and then another other day, they call a good movie terrible.",joker
"I've been a fan of this movie for years, and after watching the Folie a Deux, this movie should be considered a masterpiece. Incredible acting, amazing music and fantastic cinemography. Joker is a must watch and an all out masterpiece of everything film.",joker
"Watching this again five years later, which ironically, this film had just turned five years old yesterday (today being October 5th), and I will say what I'd thought this was indeed a masterpiece, I kinda had some second thoughts since I'm a little wiser as I'm getting older. Not to say that this is a terrible movie, but rather still one of the best movies out there when it was released in 2019. We can already say that the acting was amazing, the cinematography was amazing, even the setting was amazing. Not to mention how this sets in about mental illness and social problems when it came to delivering the message from Arthur himself. Funny, if you remember a cartoon called Duckman, I couldn't help but imagine the character of the same name say the same lines as Joker made while also keeping that line in mind since we live in a dysfunctional internet culture of today. Sure, you could say society is as mucky as it normally does, whether you're sane or not. I am aware about Joaquin Pheonix's strict diet to play the role, but one thing I have to say is that it is a job, after all. Sometimes you're dedicated to do as request or turn it down and walk away as it's always been such for decades, whether you work with Hollywood or anywhere else, big or small. Now, about some things that does cross my mind is having to think about the actions that Arthur has done off camera does have me guessing, but technically you'd have to use your sense of imagination to figure out if certain events had happened or not like when he was at his ex-girlfriend's apartment room. Also, I was curious on the jump cut at the ending, which I won't spoil too much, but curious how Arthur had gotten to that after a certain time of event as the ending rolls on. But I digress. For the most, I still had a fun time, had some good laughs and does keep me laser focused from start to finish after seeing this again for the second time, especially before I see this sequel for myself. I'd give it nine dancing Arthur's out of ten. 9/10.",joker
"This is a very difficult movie to review. Which is both a good thing, and a bad thing. I went in with an idea that this was going to be a strange movie, and I was not disappointed. The positives were pretty much the same as the previous Joaquin Phoenix interpretation. A stellar performance, although getting a second Oscar for playing the character would probably be a reach. The story was well written, and although I wasn't a big fan of the first movies ending, it seems that this one a slightly better one, despite the fact that it came from out of the same left field corner alley. I was also skeptical of the fact that it's a musical in the truest sense of the word. Although I admit I was pleasantly surprised that chose to use mostly classic show tune numbers. I'm not a huge Lady Gaga fan, but I thought her and Phoenix played well off each other, resulting in a ""decent"" vocalization performance on both parts, which gave the movie a realism that you don't usually see in musicals. I would have liked to have seen Lady Gaga portray a more ""traditional"" rendition of Harley Quinn, but it's hard to say if she would have been able to pull it off, and still keep a realistic tone in the movie. The fact this, like the previous movie, was only loosely based on the DC comics, was not an issue, although anyone watching this with said notion will be disappointed as they probably were if they saw the first. I'm not sure if this is a primary interpretation of either of the films, but they seem to imply that certain people, for better or for worse, have the ability to ""polarize"" communities as a whole to the point that they lose control of those that are captivated by the mere existence of their fixation. C+",joker
"Acting and brilliant general filmmaking saves it enough for me to give it a star and a half, but this movie loses itself in the message it hopes to leave. It clearly wants to send one message, but actually sends another, and me being a critically thinking person with a full functioning brain that actually gives a F, this movie me had me cringing and raging inside for how blind the filmmaker was when he did this. And I’m glad the sequel just proved my point.",joker
Joaquin Phoenix’s performance inspires empathy in the viewer and I was along for his journey for the first 2/3 of the film. The ending feels rushed though and it’s hard to believe that all these people would be inspired by him after just one murderous interview.,joker
"*Joker* is a brilliant character study with Joaquin Phoenix delivering an outstanding, raw performance. The film's strength lies in its exploration of Arthur Fleck's descent into madness, blending gritty drama with Gotham City's eerie atmosphere. I love how it keeps you guessing what’s real and what’s imagined, making the audience question Arthur's reality. However, it's a strange choice to connect it to the DC universe, as it feels disconnected from Batman or the traditional Joker character. Story-wise, it heavily mirrors *Taxi Driver* and *The King of Comedy*, which makes it feel less original, but the execution still works. Despite being a bit overrated, it remains an engaging watch with strong visuals and intense emotional depth. It may not be groundbreaking, but *Joker* offers an easy-to-follow, gripping character study that holds up on multiple viewings. Phoenix’s performance alone makes it worth watching again and again. 3.5 stars.",joker
"Esse filme é perfeito, traz muita reflexão sobre classes sociais e doença mental, não é um filme sobre a vida real até porque o filme é inspirado e baseado num personagem fictício com referências a Thomas Wayne e Bruce Wayne, o que reforça a ideia de ser uma peça baseada nos quadrinhos da DC. Atuação magnífica do Joaquin Phoenix, fotografia e figurino dignos de Hollywood, um filme que quem gosta do personagem em quadrinhos, vai amar com toda certeza está obra cinematográfica.",joker
"After having just watched Folie à deux, the comparison to this film is that, Joker was the old tree with the swing. Folie à deux was the wind in the leaves of the old tree with the swing. There is solidity to this that the second film does not touch. Hopefully not going to try to make A Nightmare on Elm Street kind of thing.",joker
"Oddly enough the second movie was so bad it ruined the 1st one for me. It left a taste so sour that I can't even enjoy this character any longer when I watch the first movie. A sad boring, unfulfilled character that doesn't even fit into the Joker story. This Joker is only the Joker in name.",joker
"Go into the movie with an open mind folks ! dont be to critical its a portrayal of a physcopath.. no more no less....remember this is a movie to provide pure entertainment!!! saw it last night with my family and we all enjoyed it. Well made , cinematography ....music dialog and the esquisite acting by Joaquin Pheonix.. lady gaga as a music performer shows her marvelous talent as an actor. this is not your typical character as portrayed in the Marvel series. if this one is to much for you.. Go see Thor Love and Thunder.... anyway, my honest take on this ! cheers.",joker
I had to review this movie to remind everyone how this is so much better than that god awful sequel. Everything the 2nd one had had nothing to do with this movie. The sequel was pretty much a big middle finger to the fans that loved the first one. Shame on the creators and Warner Bros. for giving us that pile of stink of a sequel.,joker
"A subversive and striking experience that brings this iconic character from the world of superheroes to a world that is more real and visceral than ever before. Arthur's suffocating solidity is transmitted to the viewer in a claustrophobic and beautiful work. The Joker's miserable life together with the miserable Gotham are the perfect portrait of a broken society, formed by broken people and generating broken people.",joker
"Se volete guardare un documentario sui disturbi mentali, lasciate stare. Se tenete a mente che state per assistere all’’esasperazione della realtà, invece, non potrete che amare questo film.",joker
Beautifully filmed. Artistic. I want to watch it again because there were so many details I missed! The music was great- excellent cinematography! Incredible performances. Academy award winning role for Joaquin Phoenix. Loved it!!! It’s dark and deep but worth the investment. It makes you think.,joker
One of the best adaptations of the Joker on par with Health Ledgers performance can’t say which is better because they are both great in their own ways this movie came by surprise and took everyone by storm with how great it is amazing story and great movie and great performance from Joaquin Phoenix.,joker
"One of my all time favorite movies. When it came out, it was an instant classic. The best way to have experienced this movie was in theaters. The intensity of the score leading up to the last scene. It's a near perfect film to me. The score and plot worked so well. Joaquin Pheonix deserved the awards he got for this film. Masterpiece.",joker
"A great movie with a lot of varied and talented actors, this unlike Folie a deux, tells a great story and has a good and gripping plot. Great cinematography, lightning and atmosphere.",joker
"It's very unique to make a Joker movie and make him in your own image from how he's portrayed in the DC Comics. That name alone, ""Arthur Fleck"", fits Joaquin's character so perfectly, but was slumped around a few times. River would be so proud of his brother.",joker
Very risky portraying a famous character and changing his origin however it worked as it was the first major villain movie where we care about the character and how smooth and natural the transition of the Joker character is. I was stunned with the visuals and brilliant acting from Joaquin Phoenix as he showed his style of what the Joker should be.,joker
"Joker is supposed to be a mob boss and ladies man. Scrawny, meek talking Joaquin didn’t make me feel like his Joker could lead a rebellion with any woman he wants by his side. Whether Joaquin was doing as told or he simply wasn’t the right man for the part the Joker’s personality ruined the film for me.",joker
"How in the fuck did this movie only get 69%? It's literally one of the best ""comic book"" movies ever made!... and it's not even a traditional comic book movie either! It took itself super seriously but didn't go overboard in the process either. 4½★'s... it's a no doubter in my mind, and Joaquin Phoenix gives one hell of a gODDAMN performance in addition to everything else that this movie handles basically perfectly. After hearing just how disastrous ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" was, I can't figure out if that means that this movie's rating should get boosted up a little bit or if it means that it should go down a little bit. After sitting on it for a few minutes, I've decided that ""Joker: Folie à Deux"" was SOOOOO FUCKIN' BAD that the initial 2019 ""Joker"" movie should have its overall rating go up but just by a little tiny bit;... but it DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T be anything major... ya know what I mean? *SO IT'S GOING FROM 4/5★'S TO 4½/5★'S HAHAHA",joker
"Joaquin Phoenix delivered a great performance, as he usually does, but the rest of the movie felt like a tub of tragic and awkward ideas flung down a flight of stairs. The best part of the movie is that I never have to watch it again. I definitely won't be seeing the sequel.",joker
I put off watching this movie for a long time because I am a fan of comic books. Nobody asked for a Joker movie and it wasn't suppose to be connected to the larger DCU. This movie is amazing and I think that is because it does its own thing. Mental illness is a difficult thing to write and even more difficult to write correctly. His journey into embracing madness it really well written and executed. I have heard a lot of mixed things about Joker 2 but I am going to at least watch it. If it sucks I can at least enjoy this one.,joker
"It’s the most pathetic, self righteous, dull, version of the Joker to ever cross pop culture. I was excited for this movie, then I saw and immediately went to set myself on fire to cleanse myself of this trash. Nothing about this movie is redeeming.",joker
"This is a really difficult but interesting psychological drama. This is the movie that presents you with a villain that you are not aware of, this villain is the public that doesn't pay attention to the little people, and from that comes the main character of the movie Arthur (the Joker), a poor man whose whole life the public hurt him and not only the public but also those around him (such as his mother or his co-workers). This is a movie that warns us viewers, ""Don't be like that, be better"" Regarding the main actor - Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur (the Joker) in a fantastic and perfect way, it's not just that he won the Oscar, he really deserves it. I wish all movies based on comics would be this good, one day maybe it will be.",joker

"The movie starts off with a cartoon, and I knew I was in for trouble. Is it a musical? I really wanted to walk out. I kept on hoping something would happen. But it never really did. Lady Gaga is great and she played the role well. This is not a Batman/joker movie. I really don’t know what it is. It sucks.",joker
"A very well produced and very well acted movie. It’s also intriguing the whole way through. It’s just unclear what the message is, but safe to assume it should just be seen as a character study.",joker
"Batman, who hasn’t appeared yet, isn’t necessary to the narrative. In fact, the film probably thrives without him, allowing this version of the titular character to feel refreshingly original.",joker
"10/10 Outstanding movie with a haunting performance and best character development ever seen. Every once in a while a movie comes, that truly makes an impact.",joker
"Why assume this masterpiece must be social commentary or have any point at all other than to wonderfully flesh out the Joker as a living, breathing human being, abused, bullied and marginalized by society. His development and his motivations are clearly depicted. Joaquin Phoenix is Arthur Fleck.",joker
Overhyped.. you can't make a Joker movie without Batman.. i just don't see why this movie was made if it isn't somehow connected to him. If it weren't called Joker it might have been a nice Drama. Phoenix' acting is very good tho,joker
"One of the best comic book movies ever. One big complaint i have seen with this movie is the ""obsession"" with ""imitating"" Scorsese's work. However, let's be true here, if ""imitating"" Scorsese's work was a crime, more than half of Hollywood would get the death sentence. This is a great movie with a absolute immaculate performance by Phoenix; and a great portrait of the sickness in our modern society.",joker
"Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job in this movie. I'm not a fan of thrillers and I get quite uneasy when I see blood and weapons, but the story of Joker really kept me interested. It took me a little while to get into, but once I was in, I was fully set on finishing the movie in one go even though I had told myself I could only watch half of it because I needed to go to bed. Might regret this in the morning but the movie was enjoyable!",joker
"With Joaquin Phoenix at the peak of his entire acting career, Joker offers a new look at superhero cinema, giving us a dark film, with a critique of society and how people abandon the mentally ill and those below them, it is not perfect, it has its flaws, but it all results in an entertaining film, with spectacular performances and a cult masterpiece for the audience.",joker
"The acting is superb, Joaquin Phoenix does an incredible job tying in mental illness with societal pressures and treatment as the reason why this demonic character of the Joker came to be as a criminal. Zazie Beetz, Robert De Niro etc are great in it. It's a unique fresh take and treatment of Joker as a movie, am glad it's in its own universe seperate from The Batman, but I would love to see how far it goes as a series or trilogy to where it might include Batman at some point. Not sure how that would happen given the time frames for how they set things up but even without Batman it's just a fantastic movie.",joker
"Joaquin is fantastic and the movie has on the edge of your seat with what he's going to do next, even it it overshadows the deeper themes going on.",joker
"This movie is pathetic. The writers have clearly never read anything about the Joker. This isn't the Clown Prince of Crime who's criminal genius rivals Batman's intellectual acumen. This ""Joker"" is a cry baby mommas boy. A complete sissy with a low IQ. This movie is an insult to the Joker.",joker
"One of the most overhyped and overrated movies of the century. Joker isn't even a good movie, I don't understand why everyone thought it was so great. Heath Ledger is better, and Todd Phillips is not a very good director.",joker
"The modern Taxi Driver. This movie could have only been made, with an A list actor, by loosely being glued together by superhero lore. This is a film with a lot to say about the current state of the world in terms of mental health and social engineering. Phillips is kind of a genius, not necessarily in terms or writing or directing, but for selling a genuine movie underneath the guise of another lame pop shtick blockbuster that would otherwise never be made.",joker
"Genuinely don’t get the hype with this movie! It’s a movie about a guy with mental health problems, and the only thing that ties it to DC and The Joker is Pheonix doing that unbearable laugh he does. Not for me thanks",joker
"Uncontrollable laughing as a symptom of an illness is the dumbest thing I've ever had to tolerate. Clearly screaming for academy attention, boring and overdramatic. The least Joker-like presence ever brought to screen.",joker
"I believe that this is a fantastic adaptation for the Joker. This movie kind of humanizes the iconic character who has done many terrible crimes. With the Joker being humanized he becomes more relatable with his struggles with mental health and feeling like he is alone and that no one cares about him. I have had struggled with depression in the past and when I first saw this movie I was able to understand and sort of relate to his viewpoint on mental health. Joaquin Phoenix did phenomenal in this roll and his use of emotions really tied together the movie for me. It truly shows a perfect way for a breakdown, besides the killing. All in all it was a phenomenal movie and I am excited for the second one.",joker
"My scoring is less the mark of what I feel is a bad movie, more that its one made for another audience. There's a great book called Junky. It's a miserable read. The life of a heroin addict. Strangely enough, its a miserable experience...like the book. This film's attempt to get inside the head of The Joker is that. A superbly made and acted journey tracking the creation of a monster. This works only if that's your what rocks your boat.",joker
"I am not a DC fan even though their movies are good, I loved this movie. The story of the joker is so sad and you understand why he’s the villain and Joaquin phoenix does really good as the joker too! The score was good, the cinematography. I actually got emotional watching this. I recommend this. One of my favorites!",joker
It's sad to watch such a powerful film be beaten down by agendas and hate. The start of one movement doesn't mean all other issues are nullified. I truly hope they weren't influenced or threatened into 'sabotage by sequel'. At least the Academy didn't cave (or didn't have time to).,joker
despite the score i LOVE this movie. The camera work is impeccable. The acting especially with the off script moments felt just perfect. Joker is relatable and i love the emotion within his character as a whole. I’m so excited for the next movie to be released.. i’ll be front row.,joker
A truly remarkable movie hiding behind something it isn’t. Don’t watch this if you’re expecting a superhero movie. This examines the spiralling issues that mental illness can trigger. A total must see.,joker
"I really don't understand the high ratings for this boring movie. The Joker comes across as just another guy with mental health issues who indulges in a bit of mindless, thug violence. He's supposed to be an extremely intelligent, evil genius with highly capable physical prowess. He is none of that in this mediocre movie and the final act that supposedly just instantly inspires all this admiration and people taking to the streets is completely unbelievable!",joker
Somehow this movie gets you to root for the bad guy. He’s sympathetic and terrible. The world of joker is so gross and depressing you’d do anything you could to escape.,joker
I can definitely see why some people would love this movie but I can also see why some peoples dislike this one. Some people just think this movie is a clever idea but just don’t like it but others might like the idea of a joker movie with this style. I give it a 6/10,joker
"Even though Todd Phillips' take on the iconic DC villain Joker isn't quite perfect, its direction and dark tone is very well done along with the performance by Joaquin Phoenix.",joker
This has to be the most over-rated movie I've ever seen. I was bored through the whole movie. I found it quite stupid and dull. The only entertaining part was the end where he killed the talk show host. That's all folks!,joker
"After delivering a masterpiece like The Dark Knight, people's expectations for a sequel naturally rise, and Nolan doesn’t disappoint at all. Matching the level of The Dark Knight seemed almost impossible, but this movie takes the story to an even bigger scale and gives it an absolute, one of the best endings for a character like Batman as well as Bruce Wayne.",joker
"A more ""real-world"" origins for one of the most celebrated comic book villains of all time, JOKER is a fine dramatic thriller with some incredible performances, a brilliant musical score and stunning cinematography. But, the movie is far from great, completely sidestepping the impact of Gotham itself and being extremely one-sided in how it never leaves Arthur's POV. It's good, but it could've been great.",joker
This film is a masterpiece! I saw it at the cinema a handful of times and have now watched it that many times I've lost count - Joaquin really embodies the character of Arthur Fleck and it truly was amazing. I'm hoping the sequel is just as good!,joker
"""Joker"" sem dúvida tem a melhor interpretação de um ator da história do cinema, pois é indiscutível que Joaquin Phoenix se empenhou demais nesse papel, que almejou a perfeição, sendo o ponto mais alto do filme. Aproveitando a bela interpretação, em Gotham dos anos 1980, Todd Phillips explora esse lado que ainda não vimos, com cenas chocantes e impactantes.",joker
"Very artsy film. I hadn’t watched it when it first released and now that the sequel is coming out I want to give it a go. While this is nothing like the comic joker, this was well acted and could spin off into a franchise where we finally see how joker recruits his henchmen and builds his empire. There are times it is a bit slow and drags on but the acting and plot make up for it. Phoenix nails his version of the laugh.",joker
"The movie introduces the setting and character really well, then drags on and on showing the transition of Arthur to Joker. Then once Joker emerges, the movie rushes the pace and crams in the ending. It could have been so much better. More a forced, social commentary piece than an interesting character movie. Too long and a waste of time.",joker
"Watching ""Joker"" in two sessions on two different planes might not have been ideal, but honestly, even under perfect conditions, this movie feels like it’s trying too hard to be profound. The hype set the bar so high that it was almost inevitable it wouldn’t live up to it. It’s an interesting slow burn, but the suspense just wasn’t there for me, and I struggled to connect with the characters. The whole movement sparked by the murder of three guys on a subway felt a bit far-fetched. And Joker’s descent into madness? It seemed like it was only half-baked, more a stumble than a true spiral. Most frustrating of all, it felt like nothing really happened throughout the movie. And if nothing’s going to happen, you’d at least hope for some standout characters to carry the weight, but even that fell short. It’s one of those films that tries to be deep but ends up feeling a bit hollow.",joker
"Joker (2019) will never be a great movie, but I feel that its up there. Reading reviews people seem to forget the movies are based on comics and are not to have much association with the ""real world"" but more with the DCU though it may not be consider part of the DCU or DCEU. This movie makes a great tell of the Joker's upbringing and a detailed look into why. It does it's job and conveys it enjoyably without making it confusing.",joker
Awesome in every way Wish dc /wb would do more character studies like that So much potential iam thinking about Mr freeze or clay face for example,joker
"This movie explains how society, mistreat and misuse people, how the government don’t care for people with mental illness and and instead, Dean them as Evil and weird. This movie is a 10 out of 10. I don’t think I have any mental illness, but I surely understand.",joker
"My streaming app glitched 20 minutes before the movie ended, and I just didn't care enough to open it back up and finish watching it",joker
"I liked this movie quite a bit, but I can not give it any higher than a 7/10 because of how blatantly it rips off Martin Scorsese classics",joker
"Visceral, real and simply unmissable. Joker is not only one of the best films of its kind, but it is also one of the greatest of this century. Its critical review is completely absurd and embarrassing, even here, when the film was present at the main awards and delivered the best performance of Phoenix's career. Masterful and completely sensational easily define this work by Todd Phillips!",joker
this was the greatest movie i have ever seen it show everything you need to know building up to batman phoenix was the best actor for this film i would 100% show this to people who know a little about batman but not all that,joker
I don't think that a better actor could interpetrate the character like Joaquin Phoenix. That's the first movie in my life that made me speechless for the quality of it. Top 7 movie that i ever saw and best 2019 movie.,joker
"Phoenix is self a indulgent actor at the best of times, but in Joker he is insufferable. Its an ok film, but Phoenix is an over hyped actor and there are better actors out there that don't get his kind of attention.",joker
"As a psychotherapist and a person with mental illness, I can say subjectively, that anyone who's suffered mental health issues will understand the depth of this movie. It's slowly paced, but it is a brilliant take on severe mental illness and how society treats those who are mentally ill as ""outcasts"". To those who have an empathetic nature, has gone through mental illness (and is aware of their illness, aka not in denial), Joker will resonate with you as it depicts a character who you may see in yourself.",joker
"The best thing about Joker is the better films it constantly reminds you of. Other than that, it's a bloated nothing-burger with all the subtlety of a brick to the skull.",joker
"Dark, Sick, and saddening everything that describes the joker. Todd Philips does amazing at giving us a look at Gotham. The acting is great, cinematography is great. 4/5",joker
"I remember watching this in theaters and it was incredible. I can't wait for the sequel coming out in October and Lady Gaga's portrayal as Harley Quinn. If its trailer is anything to go by, it will be just as good as the first.",joker
"I can understand why this can be polarizing. I can see why someone would see this potentially as glorifiying Mass shooter types, or painting mental illness as old fashioned Norman Bates crazy stereotypes. But it's much deeper than that an is a deconstructive character study done 70's style on what could drive someone insane who is responsible. Is it nature or nuture? Are we born mad or made mad or a bit of both? Even after the great plot twist it's never clear what is real and what isn't. It's a portrait of madness and the fallout asking uncomfortable questions. It's one of the darkest if not the most disturbing comic book movie ever made. But also an All Time Classic. Really the only issue is it fits ALOT of ideas into under 2 hours extremely well but it can feel a stuffed more than bloated but the editing is really good still. It's cinematography is inspired by the likes of Se7en and Fight Club and does it admirably. The supporting cast is very good but almost comedically over the top ""Evil"" and mean. But Phoenix steals the show and gives an amazing performance. It is fasinating watching him go down the rabbit hole of madness and the deeper it goes the more riveting it becomes. Everyone should give this a try once. It will 100% leave an impression even if you don't love it.",joker
This is an incredible movie and is my personal favourite movie. I would give it a 10/10 and anybody who hasn’t seen this movie should watch it immediately,joker
"Joaquin Phoenix shows, again, how incredible he is. Amazing movie, easy 9.5/10. Great story, acting, music, etc. Watched many times. Already a classic. A Joker masterpiece.",joker
I know it's good. Everything about it comes off as very near perfectly executed. So I am at a loss as to why I found it so slow and ultimately disappointing,joker
"Overrated. Sorry, I just don’t get all the hype with this one, and I don’t like being preached at. Okay, Hollywood we get it, if only we had free healthcare and took everyone’s guns away all of our problems would be solved. Not to mention that there is no way this sad-sack Joker turns into the sadistic, agent of chaos we all know so well. He’s no Heath Ledger, but Phoenix’s performance was great, no doubt, but not the best this year. And if he hadn’t won, we’d have been spared his driveling excuse of an acceptance speech.",joker
Esse filme na minha opinião e o melhor filme baseado em um vilão de super herói de todos os tempos ele consegue trazer uma história muito bem construída com uma ambientação muito bonita mesma o ator que fez o coringa e excelente consegue encorporar o personagem de um jeito muito execelente e todos os personagens desse filme são muito bem construído e agora que vem uma sequência desse filme estou muito ansioso já que essa história conseguiu manter um trama perfeito do começo ao fim me incomoda um pouco ele ser irmão do Bruce mas tirando isso esse filme e fenômeno simplemente cinema assitia recentemente depois de varias cenas emocionante que eu vi a respeito desse filme e digo e confirmo não me arrependo recomendo demais,joker
"This movie amazingly represents how villains aren't born, they're made. We never feel anything but resentment for the villains but this movie delves into mental illness and the torment that Arthur (Joker - Played by Joaquin Phoenix) throughout the film. I felt a real connection to the characters in the movie and had mixed feelings because I was rooting for the villain. I can't recommend this movie enough and it's definitely one of my all time favorites!",joker
"Esse filme é essencial para fãs do personagem, a narrativa apresentada aqui nos faz entender o lado do Coringa, pois o filme aborda temas fortes como saúde mental, e Joaquim Phoenix mostra uma atuação excepcional aqui. Gostei muito!!",joker
"""Joker"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the depths of the mind of one of pop culture's most iconic villains. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a magnetic and captivating performance, elevating the film to new heights of excellence. With a dark and viscerally powerful narrative, ""Joker"" offers an emotionally intense reflection on society and human nature. Undoubtedly, it is the best film from DC, a landmark that defies expectations and redefines the superhero movie genre.",joker
Joaquinn Phoenix did what i think is one of the best enterpretations of the joker. he is an insane man but for some reason one of the most relatable characters i've ever seen in a movie.,joker
"Villains aren't born; they're made. Oddly, we don't usually feel sorry for villains, but this film subverts that idea by showing us the mental turmoil that can drive someone to act much more sinister.",joker
"I waited until June 2024 to watch this movie. I can’t believe someone actually greenlit this absolute hack redo of the king of comedy and had the gall to include Robert De Niro to boot. This movie is an OK attempt at acting from River Phoenix’s brother and an even worse attempt at hack directing. I would put this in the worst movie of all time hall of fame. No point, no plot, no direction. I poop better movies daily.",joker
"The critics seemed stiff on this one, absolutely phenomenal, when you are beat down and broken sometimes vengeance is the only reason that keeps you going as the Joker shows us all to well.",joker
"Completely Garbage. There's not even an ounce of joker in Arthur. It's the equivalent of making a movie about a paraplegic Caucasian kid from Arizona who dreams about being an Olympic swimmer and calling the movie the rise of Jamaican Usain bolt. Great looking movie just not a joker film, DON'T TRY AGAIN please.",joker
"I feel like it could have been better if there was more of a focus on the mastermind side of the Joker. The Joker is very unpredictable, and incredibly intelligent. Also why is Batman so young in this? Great directing and amazing acting. They really sent it in the direction they wanted.",joker
"Captivating, Oscar-worthy performance by Phoenix powers this dark film that proves that ""Super Hero"" films can actually be about the villians, have a ""R"" rating, and don't necessarily need happy endings.",joker
"A beautiful and haunting movie that will stay with you. The influence of The King of Comedy was very apparent. If you enjoyed one, you’ll probably enjoy the other.",joker
"It's so raw, real, so natural. The acting was superb, especially from Joaquin Phoenix. There's seeing and listening to a character and then there's feeling the character. I felt him, and his emotions deeply. It was all so relatable. A man with a condition and an inner child yearning for truth, connection and his father's love. There was nothing more we needed. The Joker is a statement, and it will continue to be so for a long time.",joker
This was probably the best portrayal of the Joker to date. The Joker was humanized and given a backstory. Joaquin was brilliant in the role,joker
It tried too hard to make an artsy film out of an iconic villian. It was weird and awkward but not in a good way. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters.,joker
"just let a mad man be a mad man. maybe lay off the medical issues, but the environment and feelings this movie displays with joaquin’s performance definitely make this a must watch and great film.",joker
"Embora Coringa tenha inspiração no clássico O Rei da Comédia, ele consegue construir sua própria identidade e inovar ao trazer uma maneira diferenciada de contar histórias de super-heróis. Sem dúvidas um marco na história do cinema contemporâneo.",joker
Its overrated the acting was fine but the ending didn’t deliver and the character doesn’t feel like the joker nor is the changes they did to bruce,joker
"The genius of a mentally unstable character in a world that could happen tomorrow🤡 The strength of Joker's (2019) film is still, above all, Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker. The character is emotionally charged and disturbingly authentic. Phoenix's body language, voice and facial expressions take us deep into the mysterious and painful world of Arthur Fleck. Phoenix so immersed himself in the character that this is reflected in interviews years after the film was made. Let's hope that only in his mind is the character still in action. When it comes to why it's simply brilliant the answer lies in the fact that most of the film is based on a worldview through the eyes of a maniac. He does evil and is evil but doesn't realise it himself. But aren't there people like that around us in everyday life? In a sense, the Joker is right. Who is competent enough to say what a comedy is. If we ourselves laugh at something inappropriate on a daily basis then we too can feel the mockery of others. However, why do these people have the right to say what and how things should be. In the film directed by Todd Phillips, the story was also very thought provoking. When you look at the madness that a member of a downward spiralling society, who no one cares about, has to deal with, you start to think to yourself, what are my behaviours when I see a 'different' person. You never know what problems a stranger has to deal with both mentally and physically. The Joker is also a visually striking film. Gotham City is portrayed in a dark and decadent tone that has a chilling effect. The film's cinematography, set design and costumes create a tense atmosphere that fully engages the viewer. However, this is the film's biggest problem. It is too focused on one character and the acting of the supporting cast leaves a lot to be desired. Personally, I am a big Robert De Niro fan, but this was definitely not one of his strongest roles.",joker
"Magnificent, showing the weaknesses of society, we are awful, and we shouldn't be, we should have decency. This film perfectly shows the actual consequences of a lack of kindness in this world.",joker
"Too nihilistic for me. Arthur has no redeeming qualities to him. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him? Are you supposed to pity him? I didn't. Completely mindless violence. The only scene in the movie I liked was when he murders Randall. Other than that scene, I was bored.",joker
"A masterpiece showing what would happen if a mentally ill would make his worst ideas real, most stunningly depicted by Joaquin Phoenix. He definitely earned his Oscar. To me it's the best film so far taking place in the universe of an American superhero franchise. An absolute must-watch.",joker
"Excellent acting and cinematography, but of the 1000's of movies I've seen, there are only 2 that I would call disturbingly irresponsible pieces of art. This is one. Don't waste your time, it's 2 hours you'll never get back.",joker
Well mental illness and struggles are hard to define from person to person ...I am over 60 ..in pain with arthritis and loosing hearing plus anxiety & depression as conjoined twins .. which I never thought I would get to at this stage ...but finding anyone putting these awful issues of trauma ...hurt ..despise ...vengeful thoughts ?? I came out of the cinema pretty shaken and first words were ...' what the hell did I just see' ...I was put on the spot of my own issues of hate or seething..misunderstanding and just wearing life with a smile. I have watched many a DC and Marvel commentary on the big screen ..some with 'pow' ...'zap' and gotcha ...to some nonsense 3 hour slog of bum.numness..which has beat me...what Todd gave us was not refreshing but a mirror to society of our current understanding that mental illness and struggle are too hard to deal with or comprehend (plus violence) ..how to work it out ..so we going to visit part 2 and I stayed alive thus far to make it to part 2 ...however ...one day ...it will count for so much more than comic books or madness ...mayhem please see further than the end of popcorn stuffed noses and cheese stuffed nachos ...and endless pepsi refills.,joker
"An okay movie. Worth a watch. My two biggest problems are: 1. Why did this need to be a batman movie? If you took the exact same plot, set it in Chicago, took out Thomas Wayne and replaced him with some other billionaire, and instead of calling himself joker at the end, he called himself something else, would it actually change the story? I don't think so. 2. The story's themes had been done better in other movies decades ago. For the modern generation of superhero fans who've never seen films like Taxi driver, King of comedy or Falling down, the film might seem groundbreaking, but those films did the same thing and they did them much better. It's basically a Taxi driver, King of comedy mashup with a hint of Falling down with a Batman coat of paint slapped on it.",joker
"Was going into this film with low expectations, and boy did it surpass them! A very gritty and dark realism take on the Joker Character. Makes you see the world from his eyes and at points makes you feel a sense of dread just as the story's protagonist does. Nearly a flawless film in my opinion. Only main gripe is that this feels like a psychological horror film with Batman elements thrown in. But this is definitely a must watch for any movie goer.",joker
"Son unas de las mejores representaciones del origen del conocido personaje Joker, su oscuro pasado le da un toque al personaje dando más explicación sobre su personalidad demente.",joker
"Una maravillosa pelicula, sin entrar en spoilers es una genial critica a la tirania y al poco cuidado de la clase obrera por parte de la gente con mayor poder politico. Una pelicula de culto.",joker
Interesting take on mental illness and the control capitalism has on us but especially the vulnerable. Beautiful and sad and sort of scary at times while still feeling sympathetic.,joker
"In my Opinion it doesn't deserve a 69% and Joaquin Phoenix is the best Joker I've ever seen. Go watch the Movie, is pretty good.",joker
"Muito bom esse filme! Recomendo assistir. Apesar de não parecer estar vinculado a um filme de Super herói, o filme entrega muita qualidade. O Ator mandou muito bem no personagem principal.",joker
"I usually steer clear of films that consist of such disturbing themes but Joker was a brilliant exposition of the dispossessed and alienated in our society. I doubt anyone except Joaquin Phoenix could have carried the story the way he did, thoroughly deserving his Oscar.",joker
"So, if you asked me to describe Joker, I'd tell you it's an art film first and foremost. This is deconstructing the Joker mythos and applying it to a grittier Gotham backdrop for the sake of relatability and sympathy. I'm all for a sympathetic villain, but this was almost excessive. If it weren't an art film. Art films get a pass on heavy-handed social commentary, to me, because the ideas are meant to be impressionable. Very slow moving, kind of boring, but overall a decent film. Wouldn't watch again.",joker
"How excelent of an actor do you have to be, for the viewer to forget the world around him and feel the pain the main character goes trough",joker
"Joker is a fantastic film, and a compelling origin for Joker. The whole film was enjoyable, though I would say that the second half is far better than the first half, and it's not particularly close. If the whole movie was as good as the second half, it would probably be a five-star. That's not to say the first half wasn't compelling or good, but it just couldn't really match the second half. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is nothing short of amazing, with his near-perfect portrayal of Arthur's descent into madness, which is a great time to watch. The overarching plot is also very well written, witch kept my eyes glued to the screen for nearly the entire runtime. This film was also really lacking in side characters, with almost all of them being very forgettable and uninteresting, which really left only one good character (albeit one very good character) carrying its entire 122 minute runtime. Besides these flaws though, Joker is a fantastic origin story for one of the greatest villains in media, and a great film. I can't wait to see what's coming next in the sequel.",joker
"It's pretty stupid, really. It's like going to hear a rock band and the guitar player solos almost the entire time. There's nothing real in it. A total wank that's been done before and alot better.",joker
The build up origins of batman and joker at same time at the end was nuts the cast 10/10 soundtrack 10/10 the story was crazy humor 10/10,joker
"So dissapointed. I wish I had never seen or heard of this movie so I can go back to thinking to joker was an amazing villain. This movie unequivocally ruined the character, his original reasonings, and his original motivations. Wondering why joker could possibly be the way he is, is unfathomably better than this being why he is how he is. There is nothing wrong with mental illness, but insanity was the every foundation of the joker to me and that's gone now. I do not wish to spoil to the movie for you if you insist on seeing it, but I'll make a comparison to help convey what you will experience. Imagine Batman was actually Batman because he used to be a baseball player and wanted to make a pun, and he has a medical condition that causes his voice to go deeper. Also he actually refuses to kill anyone because he stopped seeing his imaginary friend when he was little, and doesn't want to see anyone else he meets disappear. That's the impeccable storytelling you're in for folks",joker
"This is the most unpleasant movie experience I've had since the first IT movie a couple years ago. My hopes were high considering the awards attention it got - culminating in a Best Actor Oscar for Phoenix. But this is an empty, superficial movie that doesn't offer any context about violence beyond what the average viewer would bring to it. I can't begin to understand the adulation this received. I won't fault Phoenix's work here - he is as committed as ever. But this is yet another case of a brilliant actor being rewarded for the wrong film. This is an ugly movie, both aesthetically and beneath the surface. Comparisons to TAXI DRIVER were made upon its release; and while I think TAXI DRIVER is a bit overrated, it is miles ahead of this movie, and I didn't find any similarities beyond a disgruntled protagonist. If you want to see a movie about the destruction of a man due to the world around him, please check out Jake Gyllenhaal in NIGHTCRAWLER instead. De Niro appears very uncomfortable in a supporting role that obviously will be compared to Jerry Lewis in THE KING OF COMEDY. This is bleak, unremitting and ultimately predictable. A crushing disappointment!",joker
"Phoenix has his well deserved Oscar winning performance. Scary enough to make you feel sorry for his evilness, yet not so evil as simply proving a point of how humanities ignorance brings out the worst in us all.",joker
"🏆95% What did I just watch, this Movie is definitely not what I expected to see out of a Joker Movie at all. I just expected a normal origin story but this Movie is more than that, this Movie is a complex story that's always one step ahead of the viewer. Did all the events of the Movie actually happened or was it all in Arthur's head, who knows? Every single scene of the Movie you wonder is everything that is happening actually real or an illusion inside the head of a madman, from the beginning of the Film where we see Arthur in a white room slamming his head against a door to the ending of the Film where he's in a white room that looks pretty much the same as the white room that he was in at the beginning of the Film it truly makes you you wonder what actually happened at the end of this Movie. Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck is absolutely amazing and his acting performance will send chills down your spine, overall Joker is a brilliant and complex piece of cinema that will absolutely blow your mind away!",joker
"This has become one of my favorite movies of all time! The acting, the story, the music and directing, it's all well thought out and presented perfectly. It's also a moral story, warning of what would happen should the rich keep getting richer, while the rest of us wallow in despair. And it also warns of what happens when those who need help most are left alone, backs turned in a callous mega city, becoming monsters made by man. And just like Godzilla was sent to punish man, Joker is sent to make everyone pay, a monster unable to be anything else, and a chilling source of pure evil.",joker
"Garbage...it's best feature is it helped me to further appreciate Tim Burton's Batman, which is far superior. Phoenix and DeNiro's talents are totally wasted here, with a story that is not just poor but downright offensive, whether intended or not.",joker
Es la mejor actuación de Joaquin Phoenix de su carrera y una excelente interpretación del Joker la película te mantiene siempre esperando la siguiente escena por lo que merece una secuela Joker 2,joker
"I really like Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie doesn't add anything to his repertoire. It's too goofy for a serious drama, and too depressing for a superhero (supervillain?) movie. The entire premise begs the question, so the entertainment value is doomed to the perversity of voyeurism. It's a good thing this is a standalone story because if this were where the Joker persona is headed, I would stop watching Batman productions altogether.",joker
"A completely value inverted world, where the low-life loser is depicted as a hero. That's what makes it completely unrealistic, bordering on fantasy... A fantasy of nihilism.",joker
"In my opinion better than suicide squad joker. This one gets to the development the reality of how someone like joker can come to be. It's more closely related to reality, on top of it this joker reminds me of my childhood joker from the cartoon batman. The laugh is on point, his hysteria, I love that the fact how they woven his joker personality not because of a chemical accident but because of a psychopathology. Suicide squad joker, was the average bad guy joker. Joaquin Phoenix is the 2nd best up to Heath Ledger's joker.",joker
"A dizzying contradiction of a film. The ideas that 'Joker' forces you to evaluate make this much more unique and worthwhile than your average comic fare, even if sometimes people may be confused WHAT the film is telling you to think about. It's powerful even if the direction becomes quite repetitive especially with how it's shot.",joker
The movie has no action. I thought the joker was a maniacle violent clown going on a killing spree and blowing things up. Heath Ledger was better. Phoenix is boring the worst joker. The movie is taking too long to show the violent side of joker.,joker
"Absolutely loved it! It depicts just how wrong the mental health facilities are and what happens when those who need it don't get help. It's ""beautifully sad"". Would and have recommended this movie! If you haven't seen it, do it. Just don't expect too much ""Batman"" there are easter eggs here and there but it's mainly a movie about why Joker/Arthur is the way he is.",joker
A tiresome spectacle of nihilism. The big finale isn't the shockingly transgressive act of violence everyone pretends it is . . . The sequence is boring and predictable.,joker
"85/100 - Fantastic film. Joaqiun pheonix did an exceptional job playing this troubled character. My only complaint is that if you watch this film and the batman films related to it, the story is incoherent as each one tries to make you sympathize with the main character. The wayne family is portrayed as cruel upper class elitist, whereas in the batman films they were portrayed as loving parents taken too soon. I just wish that the continuity of the stories blended better, but as an independent story its very good.",joker
"I was quite surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It was a lot more serious and complex than I thought it would be, but I think they succeeded in everything they were trying to do. Great movie, really enjoyed how mature it was.",joker
"You couldn't offer me $1,000,000 to sit through this garbage again. Movies are meant to be entertaining, not disturbing; I fear young people may want to view this with high expectations, only to be subjected to violence.",joker
I love the joker so much dressed up as it for Halloween killed it and Joaguin just killed this part. He sacrificed a lot to get this part too it payed off can't wait for the second one with Lady Gaga!!!.,joker
Slow and stupid. Trying to hard to be some sort of lame statement and not hard enough to be thrilling and entertaining. I really don't care about his feelings. Those of us who achieve more see those who don't as clowns.,joker
"My favorite movie is him Joker is a GOOD MOVIE, Joaquin Phoenix is amazing and powerful in his role, same for Robert De Niro, Todd Phillips managed to make the most evil psychopathic character in the world.",joker
This is actually a powerful drama about taking drugs and how they can ruin everything. It is compelling viewing but very difficult to watch. I found the ending totally enthralling and upsetting as well as disturbing. It is serious from beginning to end with no room for comedy or anything even remotely light-hearted. Be warned that this is compelling and powerful viewing. Not that I have experienced it but I found this a scarily realistic descent from drug-joy to drug-hell. Can’t say I’ll ever watch it again though.,requiemforadream
"Jared Leto's Joker Origin Story: ""Requiem for a Dream"" follows the journey of four different characters. Following the characters you see how drug problems lead to the titular death of their dreams. Don't go into this movie hoping for likable characters overcoming trials and making the world a better place. This movie showcases people at their absolute worst and highlights how bad things can get. The best attribute of the film is the editing and cinematography. Aronofsky knows how to inject a scene with energy and make this film a tight 100-minute runtime with no excess filler. Overall, beautiful camera shots, ugly needle shots.",requiemforadream
"Great film! It's extremely necessary, not because it's dull, but because it's educational. It shows us the decline of modern society as it tries to escape the surrounding reality.",requiemforadream
"I think this is a great and engrossing movie because it follows a rhythm that allows you to understand the origins of addiction in the characters. The film tells different stories through various characters and their respective traumas, showing how these lead to their destruction.",requiemforadream
"Connelly and Leto are beautiful together and Burstyn's performance alone is worth the price of admission. That said, the story was mean, manipulative (e.g., one would never undergo electroconvusive therapy w/o their consent), and one-dimensional...basically Reefer Madness 2.0, or the Walmart Trainspotting. I'm sure Reagan and the MAGA freaks would love it, basically the same people who oppose comprehensive sex education and just want teachers to scream at students ""DON'T DO IT OR YOU'LL DIE!!!"" Can we have a grown-up discussion about substance abuse, please?",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is not an easy watch, nor should it be. It’s a film that forces us to confront the darkest corners of ambition, love, and loneliness. A devastating, unforgettable experience that defines Aronofsky as a fearless storyteller.",requiemforadream
"This movie is dark and haunting, over stimulating, heavy in content. Chronos quartet's music will get to you, especially with the volume increase during the movie. I love ""drawn outside of the lines"" movies like this, definitely not everyone's cup of tea. But a ride you will get and it won't disappoint.",requiemforadream
"From a movie standpoint, characters really didn’t have any depth for me to care about anything bad happening to them. I guess the mom Sara, but at the end I was just kind of like ugh… that was it? There are much better movies out there on addiction issues that portray it just as ugly but with character development that will illicit more of an emotional response. Honestly I got pretty bored half way through.",requiemforadream
Brutal to watch. Depicts an unfortunate reality for many. Burstyn as Sara's decline especially harsh with Connely as Marion almost as awful. The male roles meet ends all to common in the drug thug life.,requiemforadream
"Disturbing. The best review I can give is I have been a paramedic for 20 years and I have seen it all. This movie is and un-diluted look at what drug addiction does to a group of characters it follows. That’s it. I won’t ruin it. People give reviews for it but that takes away from the shock. So, it makes me get misty eyed after everything I’ve done and seen. That’s a review in itself.",requiemforadream
"It’s not an easy watch, nor should it be, but Requiem for a Dream is essential cinema. Bold, nightmarish, and deeply tragic, it’s a film that dares to confront the darkness with stunning artistry. A masterpiece.",requiemforadream
Beautiful. Such a fantastic film showcasing the dangers of addiction and drugs as well as the corruption in our hospitals and prisons. The main characters are all struggling with a different form of addiction; Sara has an addiction to diet pills and struggles with being an outcast with her neighbors and son. Harry struggles with needles and pushes himself to the brink to help his girlfriend and his mother. Ty struggles with an addiction to powder and the struggles with being a young black man living in a poor financial situation. Marion gets addicted to the same powder and ends up not being able to live without it and turns to affairs after her parents neglect her needs and replace it with monetary love. It really plays with your heart and the difficulties of drugs and money— this movie will drive you to tears.,requiemforadream
"This movie is a beautiful yet unsettling experience. I first saw this when I was a teenager and was enthralled by the sound design and visionary style that makes each scene so intense. The drug scenes especially, but also those when the characters are experiencing withdrawals, or seriously uncomfortable situations. The overall vibe and ending is deeply depressing but depicts a dark place that drugs of this depth could take you.",requiemforadream
"Went to the 25th Anniversary of Requiem. Haven’t seen it on the big screen since 2000. It not only still holds up I found it to be more amazing, audacious, heart breaking and even more memorable. The cast is outstanding and what Aronofsky did creatively with his team is nothing short of genius.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream was such a powerful movie. From my perspective, it portrays four different people, each with their own struggles and traumas. On one side, we have Harry—a young man battling addiction who mostly thinks about himself. Then there’s Marion, a girl dealing with depression who seems to be searching for a way out by being with Harry, especially since she has no real support from her family. Tyrone is a character who isn’t explored in depth, but we can sense the emptiness in his heart caused by the loss of his mother. Lastly, there’s Sara—the mother, who is alone and obsessed with losing weight. This movie was difficult to watch because it shows the harsh reality of people living with these kinds of issues in a raw and unfiltered way.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is as disturbing as it is artistic—a brutal, visually striking descent into addiction and obsession. Darren Aronofsky doesn’t hold back, and I wouldn’t expect anything less from him. The film sticks with you, not just because of its subject matter, but because of how masterfully it’s told. It’s not an easy watch, but it’s a necessary one.",requiemforadream
"This is a movie that you watch once and then you never need to see it again. God forbid you are smoking during this because this will make you never want to touch drugs again. Good movies are made to elicit emotion from the viewers. However, that doesn’t mean it needs to be a good emotion.. in this case it is disgust and anxiety. Everything else is done to perfection. The movie is able to easily get points across to you without having to show you specifically what’s being done. This might be one of the best uses of split screen that I’ve seen in a movie for a while. Not to mention the scenes where certain people are sped up and others aren’t. Brilliant stuff. Lastly, the score is terrific. It really builds the tension and queues the audience in to an important moment. Overall this is a well filmed & acted movie. The topic and the way it makes you feel prevents me from going any higher than 4 stars.",requiemforadream
A shattering and fantastically-acted treatise on serious drug addiction and it's ancillary effects. It is uncompromising in the manner it draws you in and won't let you go; even when you want to look away you can't seem to.,requiemforadream
"I love the eyeball shot so much, but you know what I love more? Build up and characters. And Requiem For A Dream pulled me right into its story so early and it never lost me. I love how emotionally impacted and stressed out you’ll feel watching these characters in this movie, and a lot of that comes from the unreal performances by the entire cast. I love the films sound design and score, and the uniqueness of how they handled the editing and cinematography. The way it also handles its message of addiction felt extremely realistic and accurate, which just added to how much I was biting my nails as the film went on. Extremely well directed film, I loved it",requiemforadream
"The heaviest movie I've ever seen. Personally always speaking. It's a movie that anyone who loves cinema should see, at least once. One was enough for me.",requiemforadream
"Raw and intense, the film’s emotional weight comes through in Burstyn’s portrayal of a widower trapped in the past, descending into madness over a reality that is always out of reach.",requiemforadream
"I know it’s a very popular film, and I understand why so many people like it but I just don’t. It’s upsetting because I almost feel as if I didn’t give it a chance. I may return to this one in the future just to see my take on it then, but for now I didn’t care for it. The lady that played Sara Goldfarb gave a magnificent (and I’m not using that term lightly) performance. During her scenes I felt disturbed in a way that could only be described as… cringe? But it wasn’t cringe it was just shocking. Only Saving Private Ryan has gotten that kind of reaction out of me before I saw this. So that tells me I need to rewatch this film some time soon, I think I’ll really enjoy it. Seeing Marlon Wayans in a movie other than scary movie (or just a comedy in general) made me laugh. That’s not to say he didn’t do a good job though, because he definitely did. Jennifer Connelly was just ok, and Jared Leto was decent. 2/5 stars.",requiemforadream
this movie is gut wrenching and phenomenal. i’ve never not been able to breathe at the end of a movie because of how off putting it was but the last 20 minutes leading up to it was one of the if not the best ending scene of a movie.,requiemforadream
"Watched this masterpiece on Amazon.Consider this as similar to Magnolia or American version of trainspotting. It's dark of course the insecurity of being old resorting to prescription medication, or younger set with hard drugs. Be prepared for the last 20 minutes so.much going on especially the shock treatment part ..A refrigerator does cast on it and throughout the movie just watch how attention is paid to the prescription addicts refrigerator..",requiemforadream
"« Requiem for a Dream » fonctionne grâce à des performances marquantes. La musique renforce la tension, tandis que les couleurs saturées et le montage dynamique illustrent avec brio la chute (la dépendance) des personnages.",requiemforadream
"It was a very heavy movie, I like movies like this, but in the end, there were some very ridiculous scenes and unnecessary scenes, but there were quality scenes, I can't say it was a very bad and disgusting movie, but it was very high quality and I can't say it was great either, it had good quality scenes, there were also empty and unnecessary scenes, but the director was really in the movie. He exaggerated things a lot, I can't say it was bad or good, but I can say that it was one of the most beautiful movie soundtracks I have ever seen.",requiemforadream
"Definitely a very strong movie. One of those movies that exceeds expectations, the ending is so tragic, profound and fits perfectly with what was expected. If you haven't seen it, It will depend a lot on the impact that this type of story has on you. But nothing will ever deny that it's beautiful.",requiemforadream
"A dark, gritty masterpiece. Darren Aronofsky made a once in a career film with Requiem For a Dream. I've never seen anything quite like it, before or since. It is superbly acted, very well directed and masterfully edited. It takes you places you likely don't want to visit. The good news is, it's just a movie. A movie most definitely worth watching. I highly recommend. 97/100",requiemforadream
"A character deconstruction of addiction done Altman style that is also an All Time Classic. One of the first things you notice is the creative tour de france of editing techniques. While this is jumpy with no one characer dominating the others, it never feels unfocused, bloated, meandering, or obnoxious with more style than substance. In fact it's got both. The editing really compliments the pacing perfectly and compensates for so many different storylines. It's a very rare case where the editing really makes this work. It uses music video techniques but unlike a lot of others around this time that try that, it doesn't feel dated at all. It comes off as surreal more than anything and really fits with the subject matter. The acting is first rate and really builds as this progresses to the climatic consequences of all the characters actions. Ellen Burstyn is amazing and is the best of all fo them. Even though her story is arguably the most isolated of all four it's not any less fasinating and a real testament to ehr acting ability. It's brutal to watch and fasinating. Shot in a masterfully surreal way that again never feels showy but really amplifies the dazed and confused atmosphere of the subject matter. It's like a comprehensive Apocalypse Now for drug addiction on all sides of the trade. Everyone who has a strong stomach should give this a try once. If your familiar with the director than it helps going in knowing if you can handle it.",requiemforadream
"A very intense and rough watch, Requiem for a Dream is one of the most heartbreaking films I've ever seen. It's not just a depressing film, I really felt attached to all of the characters, and that makes it all the more sad what happens to them. This is a film that I found amazing, but that I might not want to go through again.",requiemforadream
dude honestly this is one of the most overrated movies of all time. like wayyyy too much grandma storyline. maybe my expectations were too high bc of how highly ppl regard this movie but i never write reviews either and this one honestly had to be said. wish i didnt waste my time,requiemforadream
This slow burn will make your skin crawl by the end. It's depiction of 4 people's descent into madness is unsettling and striking to say the least.,requiemforadream
"It’s well made from a technical standpoint, but I just can’t endorse this movie's overly disturbing take on the bad that can come from drug use. The characters are one dimensional and merely exist just to be tortured",requiemforadream
"Hard watch, that's for sure. Ellen B and Jared Leto acting phenomenal. Cringey in parts, his arm. Don't think I'll watch it again though, once is enough.",requiemforadream
"This really is pretentious to the nth degree. Ellen Burstyn did a great job, i'll give you that. But the film ( sorry movie) is so far up it's own *ss, it doesn't know whether it's coming or going. It's doesn't help that it has Jared Leto in it, because he just adds to the pretentiousness somewwhat. Hard hitting, hard to watch, so can only do once. Come on, it's not that bad! People need to watch Trainspotting. Because it has humour, so when the hard hitting moments come, they make so much more impact.",requiemforadream
"Unflinching, hard to watch, though an absolute must-watch, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a gut-wrenchingly horrific look into the dangers of substance abuse that gets its point across a little too well. Phenomenal acting and a powerful script help elevate the movie as well, though it really is the overall message that gets imprinted into your brain. Genuinely one of the most disturbing watches I've seen to date, but an absolutely necessary one to watch at least (and possibly most) once.",requiemforadream
"Wow, I kept putting this movie off as I thought it was going to be slow, depressing and hard to get through but I was wrong this movie kept me glued to my seat. I am glad I gave it a try.",requiemforadream
"Absolute cinema! Ele é bem pesado. Consegue te deixar bem desconfortável durante o filme. Vc realmente consegue sentir ele. A música é FENÔMENO, o som é fenômeno, a atuação tbm e aquele jogo de cortes rápidos mostrando o isqueiro borbulhando (fast cuts and close ups) é absurdo!",requiemforadream
"Combining top notch performances (particularly from Ellen Burstyn), strong subject matter, frenetic cinematography and a memorable musical score from Clint Mansell, Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream provides a haunting and intense look into drug addiction, broken dreams, isolation and despair. It's not one for repeated viewing though.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a dream is definitely not for everyone, with it's bleak and sorrow nature, however it's worthwhile with it's unique storytelling and message about the horrors of drug addiction",requiemforadream
A gut-wrenching & unforgiving tale of substance abuse that will leave an impression on you to say the least. The perfect pacing & clever cinematography only add to the haunting tone of this movie.,requiemforadream
So harrowing! Brilliant acting … Jared never fails! I first watched this when it came out and I'm still recovering .. the ending stays with you that's for sure!!,requiemforadream
"I loved the book, and I thought this was an excellent movie. I'm glad Selby co-wrote the screenplay. Kids, just say no to drugs and alcohol. If you want to know why, watch this movie.",requiemforadream
"Muito Chocante uma incrível e real jornada diretamente ao submundo das drogas, os atores desaparecem nos seus papéis é um dos melhores filmes que eu vi",requiemforadream
"Beware!You will not ever forget this movie, it shows perfectly All the complications of human nature and relationships, but it gives us an insight into the complicated relationship between addiction and love that most of us try to blind ourselves from.",requiemforadream
The movie is both amazing and disturbing. They've done a really good job at displaying the lives of addicts. It really makes you think about life and I think that everyone has to watch this movie.,requiemforadream
"A true masterpiece which should be shown to teenagers as educational material in a fight against drug use. The pacing of the movie is absolutely perfect. Connection with the characters is so good that I've almost felt physical pain at the end of the movie. In fact, the best way to describe the feeling I've got after watching it is - being hit in the face by a brick. It's one of the rare movies which brings you in its world and connects you to the characters, their hopes, dreams and ultimate demise to the point where you feel physical relief after it ends and you get back to your own life. And it's not because the movie is bad - quite the contrary. It's eye opening. It makes you glad to have your own life, in whatever mental, social or financial state you are in. It makes colors of your real world more vibrant. It simply is a requiem for a dream in every sense of that phrase.",requiemforadream
"The score, the pace, the visuals, the camera work, the acting. everything was put together to make of this movie the best movie you will not watch a second time not because it is bad but because it is that good, that powerful",requiemforadream
"It is a film that can come across as disturbing to some people probably but for me it was a really well executed idea, beautiful acting from the main actors and unique but brilliant cinematography. I think some parts of the story could have been worked on or even extended but generally the feeling/atmosphere is one of the best. Was finding myself wanting for more .",requiemforadream
"Unfiltered, disturbing yet powerful, with graphic imagery that doesn't leave the head anytime soon. Phenomenal score, great cast and some neat editing as well as cinematography. I think it's nicely structured, narrated and paced despite it being about four different characters each with their own arc. While there lacks some writing it is still beautifully directed and delivered. Many scenes that were brilliantly crafted to give off the exact essence of the moment but also a few which could have been a bit more worked on. A well executed portrayal of real-life people shown as cinematic as it gets and one that doesn't shy away from ending it all as unfortunate as possible. I thank my dear friend Jeff for this recommendation.",requiemforadream
"It's not a normal film; it's an experience. You can't watch it while chilling. It gives a deep, uncut vision of one of the darkest sides of human beings. Nothing for weak nerves.",requiemforadream
This movie is truly something. I had heard spoilers of the movie scenes and the ending and I still cried when I watched it. One of favourite movies honestly 😙👌,requiemforadream
Despair without redemption. The subject matter is very dark. The editing & score are irritatingly repetitive yet mesmerizing. The plot is thin with missed opportunities but the unique vision is captured.,requiemforadream
"At first the movie doesn't seem like it is going anywhere until it continues to escalate. Eventually reaching one of the best climaxes in cinematic history. It's a very depressing movie, but it will leave you in shock and awe after it is over.",requiemforadream
pretty hard to watch disturbing drug movie well acted and shot but its so depressing worth watching once makes you think but some will find it too disturbing.,requiemforadream
"Failure is a scary thing; everyone fears it one way or another. Requiem for a Dream hones its themes on this, and is greatly enhanced through a talented cast, this is one seriously depressing ride.",requiemforadream
"I love the theme, and I love the cinematography. I think all of the actors did a great job! I've already seen this a few times. I'm not sure why some people say they can only stomach seeing it once. While the film is somewhat dark, I consider it a masterpiece that's worth seeing several times.",requiemforadream
"6.0/10- I’m not grading this from a cinematic standpoint, but from a “that was so disturbing you couldn’t pay me to watch it again” standpoint",requiemforadream
"A shattering, mind-altering and utterly immersive psychological drama that doesn't withold, Requiem for a Dream's ravaging intensity, creative imagery and marvelous performances make it a film that positively will stick with you.",requiemforadream
"Esse filme é incrivel ele consegue nós colocar na pele dos personagem principais é muito bem dirigido os ângulos de câmera são maravilhosos a trama e o roteiro são muito bem escritos, consegue traçar um paralelo com a vida real das pessoas qur sofrem com esse vicios e o seu final é de nos fazer refletir e causar desconforto de tão inpacnatante, um filme que vale a pena assistir.",requiemforadream
"All time favorite movie, watched many times. The movie is very sad and while it definitely can seem out of touch with reality. I think the portrayals of the tragedies it focuses are depicted with the seriousness deserved. I appreciated certain creative decisions for example the slang/jive Ty and Harry use while I have never heard the slang words used outside this movie they are easily understood with context clues and give it a timeless feel - movie specific slang shouldn't become outdated so to speak.",requiemforadream
"Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is a harrowing look at addiction and obsession. Sara Goldfarb's (Ellen Burstyn) universe exists primarily within her Brooklyn apartment where, fueled by amphetamines, she obsesses about appearing on television. Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto), accompanied by his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend (Marlon Wayans), spend their days looking to score their next fix of heroin. It is a nightmarish vision from the start as the characters slowly but inevitably descend into a world of horrifying physical and mental pain, psychosis, surreal hallucinations, and the reality that there is no escape. While Aronofsky's outlandish style is sometimes unnecessarily distracting, the movie is buoyed by some stark and memorable imagery, a remarkable score by Aronofsky regular Clint Mansell, and what could just be Burstyn's career-defining performance.",requiemforadream
"Filme foda, o roteiro é legal pra caralho, as cenas são fodas, a história é legal pra caralho, o elenco é legal, e a maioria ajuda a melhorar o filme, os personagens são legais, o filme tem um drama muito forte, que fala sobre o que as drogas fazem o que a vida dos humanos, e o filme ficou mais foda ainda por conta das atuações dos atores da Ellen Burstyn que foi indicada ao Oscar e também do Jared Leto, e também dos demais atores do elenco, com tudo isso, eu recomendo muito esse filme vale muito a pena assistir, um dos melhores filmes do ano de 2000.",requiemforadream
"One of the best depictions of addiction ever put to film. Every character is dealing with their own addiciton to something, and it really hammers home that the ones who fall to addiciton often just are victims.",requiemforadream
"It was absolutely amazing. Proof that simple problems that create simple plot lines work really well. The soundtrack was one of the most amazing ones I have ever seen in a movie. The acting was amazing as well, and the topic is masterly explored. It is a movie that doesn't have a single heart-warming moment, and that is perfect considering the dark and raw atmosphere that they were trying (and successfully did) to create. Drugs can really mess you up, and this movie portrays that in a beautiful way. These four people end up in a worse and darker place by the time everything is said and done. This film takes us to a journey where we can see the addicts going from less to more, going to extreme extents to get their merchandise, and at the same time we are witnesses of their descent to insanity. Another thing I want to point out is the photography. OUTSTANDING. The way this movie uses it's cameras is astonishing. Yet again, simple but incredibly effective shots result from this work of art. This movie will raise your tension and feel the desperation from the characters. It will amaze you with its beautiful scenes and unique atmosphere. It is simple. It is intense. It is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, without a doubt.",requiemforadream
This...is one heck of a difficult film to review. You won't enjoy yourself. You're not supposed to. Aronofsky is unflinching in driving home the horrors of drug abuse - but his stylish direction distracts from as much as it enhances that goal.,requiemforadream
"QUE TRAUMA. Se la recomiendo a todos y no se la recomiendo a nadie. En serio es una película +18 pero no por la violencia o sexualidad, sino por la carga de realidad tan impactante.",requiemforadream
One of the best movies ever made in my opinion. Brutally real. An unforgettable watch that will leave you thinking about it long after the credits roll.,requiemforadream
"A deeply disturbing film -- showing graphically the effect dope has on four people's lives. All four are involved in personal relationships with each other. Dope is the catalyst but the real evil is society -- dreams that are promised and cannot be fulfilled by four inadequate people. Moreover, the way society treats its failures is gut-wrenchingly depicted. Absolutely not for the faint-hearted, not even sure myself whether I benefitted from watching it.",requiemforadream
"The editing and cinematography of this movie are absolutely riveting, and Aronofsky's direction is truly a work of art. The messages this movie displays are yet to age and the actors are firing on all cilinders. For people saying it's too dark, depressing and has no business existing, go watch Dr. Dolittle 2 for the 98th time!",requiemforadream
"The pace is frenetic. That put me off at first, but once I caught up with the rhythm I enjoyed the film. Ellen Burstyn is terrific.",requiemforadream
"As a young filmmaker this movie left an imprint. This film made the camera a stylistic element beyond anything that had been done before. Sure yes, other great masterpieces of cinema contained great portraits capture in motion, but rarely was the motion used to repeatedly tell the story. This is where Requiem For A Dream shines, the use of the camera to tell the simplest of stories, one of vice, and pain and fear, and love and joy which barely slipped through our fingers. Before the main characters have yet to live they are seeking death. Their parents, and their parents parents doing the same, except not through existential foes, but actual others, looking to submit to existence with slow death. Not by drugs, but by war, or the misery of the knowledge of what one could have been. Don't could have been is the story of this movie, summarized by lifes transposed onto drugs and violence. All the choices of the characters no matter their prior circumstances.",requiemforadream
This is really a screwed up movie it's kinda sad but it's a great movie. It's all about drugs and how they ruin your life. Well the son is a heroin addict along with his girl and his best friend. And they figure out a way to make money and able to support their habit but in the long run things just get really bad for them. Now one of the dope fiends mother tries to go on a diet and it doesn't work out so she sees a doctor and they put her on uppers. So she can eat as much as she wants and lose weight. And when she starts out taking them they make her feel really good until her body gets immune to them and then she starts craving the high and she becomes a total mess. The whole movie is great but everything gets screwed up,requiemforadream

"In this twisted Aronofsky flick, four individuals pursue love and adoration in various ways. Their changing lifestyles lead them down a rapid road of addiction, crime, insanity, and greed. Aronofsky's examination of the dreadful and long-lasting effects that these can have on human beings is agonizingly thrilling— possibly unendurable for some. Still, the dramatic thriller was executed very well and the acting was efficacious. It's mind-boggling, tragic, graphic, absolutely shuttering, but above all, realistic. I enjoyed the eeriness and the darkness of the film, but it was made to leave a sour taste in our mouths and Darren Aronofsky delivered. For the bold and disturbed, I recommend you give it a night-watch. For the more squeamish movie-goers and strangers to the psychological thriller genre, I STRONGLY caution… 88%!",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a dream is a movie that is daring with super crisp clean imagery,impeccable directing with outstanding performances from its cast. It’s a Heartwrenching look at addiction and it makes for some must watch cinema. This is my 2nd arronfsky film and I’m absolutely hooked. Grade A",requiemforadream
"Incredible score. Raw, wrenching look at what addiction does. Funnily enough, I found the mother's story to be the most captivating. The crosscutting at the end, with each character destroying themselves in pursuit of that craving, is really powerful. There are so many cringe-inducing moments in this film because of how unflinching Aronofsky is in depicting these four interconnected tragedies. Not a fun film to watch, but it is a resounding display of filmmaking.",requiemforadream
"The acting was phenomenal. I agree with others it is a difficult watch. I found the storyline to be a bit cliche, very much in line with something we would have been shown in middle school to scare us away from drugs.",requiemforadream
"While a bit clunky and jarring for a viewer, who can't help get the theme of this movie stuck in one's head?

What a great disturbing experience. I cannot express by just seeing the cruelty of the director in all scenes. Just well-directed one of the world's best movies. The Heart content is in there. It's not for the faint-hearted folks. It's one of the most horrifying psychological thrillers I ever saw. It's cruelly testing all of your nerves in every single part of the film. Awesome watch,requiemforadream
"A shocking and punching movie that you'll never forget. You see the dreams of each and everyone of the characters be canceled by this drug and it absolutely pushes you away from this. It is a really good way to give a life lesson to people of 15-18 that watches this. Never start because you may be like them. The story of the four characters were tragic but you just wanted them to succeed and that is why I love this movie. The story is perfect and the acting makes the movie more watchable. After this, the original soundtrack of this movie is unforgettable, splendid. I just didn't like that much the repetitive use of little sequences before they take drug or something. I don't know how to call it, but it was a bit too much. A really good movie and a must see.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is an interesting psychological drama film about drug use. American director Darren Aronofsky successfully portrays the drug addiction of the four protagonists and its consequences on their physical and emotional state. The interpretations of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans are remarkable and, in particular, that of Burstyn, who manages to completely fit into her character. The film also features the extensive use of short cuts, split scenes, and very tight close-ups. Finally, the movie soundtrack composed by Clint Mansell, and which includes the famous track Lux Aeterna, is simply extraordinary and is a fundamental component of the film. One of the best movies about drug addiction.",requiemforadream
"A visceral and uncomfortable viewing, but not one to be missed. Requiem won’t be for everyone, but it examines an ugly side of human nature and the unfortunate consequences of addiction in a blisteringly chilling way. The performances were excellent and the commitment was real. It’s not a particularly re-watchable film, but it’s a cult classic to add to the list",requiemforadream
"An interesting movie that didn't hit me as hard or intense as it may others. The film portrays the descent into addiction of four related but different individuals. While it's supposed to be an emotional and psychological thriller, it didn't necessarily bring out those feelings in me. I felt bad for the characters and their decision making skills but the progression of the story moved too quickly at times for me to build strong connections with those involved. However, the performances are tragically beautiful and the story is tragically bleak. The portrayal of drugs and its effect on the lives of its users and others around them is the central point and in that sense the film succeeds. Nonetheless, this film will hit harder to those who've been affected by the subject matter or have knowledge on the topic.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream shows excellent performances twisted in a world of addiction and struggle. It is at times hard to watch but it shows the reality of addiciton with tough scenes and memorable performances.

"""Requiem for a Dream"" is an American psychological drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky in 2000. It is adapted from Hubert Selby Jr. in 1978. The film describes four characters affected by drug addiction and how it changes their physical and emotional states. Their addiction makes them imprisoned in a world of fantasy and despair. As the movie develops, each character will deteriorate and their reality will be replaced by fantasy, leading to disaster. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a movie of four Americans who have fallen from power. They have no bright future but resort to stimulants. When Sara hoped to find a way out of chemical happiness, for her son Harry, his girlfriend Marian and friend Tyrone, she also got used too the pills and even mother Sara Goldfarb fell into a downward spiral. At the beginning of the film, she still tried to guide the child on the right path by tying the TV he wanted to sell to the radiator, but when a rogue nutritionist confessed to a somewhat neurotic sixty-year-old that she might lose weight, because of the pills she didn't want to stop taking them and got addicted. The movie focuses on the lives of the residents of Coney Island, and the film shows the consequences of addiction and obsession and how obsession leads to addiction. By playing with different camera angles and the smooth editing work, a special film experience is created. Just like the audience has experienced the pain of various characters. Jared Leto convincingly plays the role of drug addict Harry Goldfarb, and he will do his best to get the last batch of heroin. But money is a problem. He has no choice but to force his addict girlfriend Marion into prostitution, and the latter is a brilliant role played by Jennifer Connelly. His good friend Tyrone, played by Marlon Wayans, also tried to control his addiction, but his efforts were in vain. When friends were struggling with addiction, Harry's mother Sara was glued to the tube when she called for contestants on her favorite TV show. She is determined to participate, but needs to lose a few pounds to wear her favorite clothes. Her obsession with television made her addicted to drugs that can speed up the weight loss process. But the result was disastrous, and Sara slowly and surely seemed to lose control of reality. The exorcist actress Ellen Burstyn played a very good role. ""Requiem for a Dream'' is a drama film that makes you think, but also gives you a bad feeling. The film clearly shows how strong an addiction can be. But also how strong an obsession can be and that this can lead to rash choices with disastrous consequences. Requiem for a Dream is, for me, the example of a good film that I never need to see again. It made me quite depressed. With this masterpiece, he impressed me as a viewer.",requiemforadream
"This movie has the best music score. The movie shows you how far people can go just to prove that they are something, even though that chase might/will destroy you. Also, we need some limits, otherwise we will lose control.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a dream is not a depressing film as people exclaim it to be but is a film crafted to talk about tragedy highlighting the harsh realities of life. With beautiful visuals that portray important observations, I can't ponder enough about the appropriate score that suits it comfortably. But in the end, the film fails to provide crucial stepping stones for the plot to accelerate.",requiemforadream
"RATING: A- Director: Darren Aronofsky Requiem for a Dream is a film that's nothing for the faint hearted. The four leads are really good, considering that the film has only very little minor characters, Ellen Burstyn is definitely the standout right here. The Style and Cinematography are good and they try to do a lot with split screens and pulling the fantastic Score throughout the entire movie. In one sentence, this is a Masterpiece but I'll never ever want to watch it again.",requiemforadream
"A Masterpiece that doesn't hold back and doesn't care if the audience is okay with that decision or not. That's what makes it a true legend in the world of film; once seen, unable to be forgotten. A movie that stays with you forever and perhaps was a bit ahead of its time so far as the extreme nature through which its subject matter of addiction and subsequent downward spiral is displayed, resulting in everything from the perfect technical aspects of score to cinematography and editing, all the way up to the acting talent on display from the four leads, who are arguably two leads (Leto and Burstyn) and two supporters (Connelly and Waynes), all of whom could and should have been nominated for their performances, all of whom carried their weight, and when combined resulted in one of the most gut wrenching, unforgettable, real, true, horrific, and polarizing movies of a generation. There's just simply no other movie like Requiem for a Dream.",requiemforadream
"I know its well acted, well directed etc, etc but it was such an unpleasant watch that I can't rate this film that high. Obviously it was supposed to be a downer but I couldn't find any kind of love from the filmaking because it was a slog to watch these characters spiral into the darkest of pits. Certainly a onetime watch and I'm really only rating it this high because of the technical aspects of Requiem, nothing else.",requiemforadream

"""In the end it's all nice."" I've put off watching ""Requiem for a Dream"" for forever given the grim subject matter. A recent re-review by Jeremy Jahns motivated me to finally watch it. And hoo-boy, what a bleak and brutal masterpiece. It's clearly Darron Aronofsky's best and most compelling work. The acting is phenomenal. The editing, cinematography, and filming style is just amazing and innovative. The way he brings to life four different character arcs such that we care about each and everyone of them shows an artist who is a master at his craft. For some reason I didn't have the passionate reaction to this as the many fans/critics that absolutely adore the movie. This may be a generational issue. Trainspotting was more to my personal liking which I think has to do with the soundtrack which for me really elevated it to a more re-watchable film. Trainspotting may have more comedy, but it can get super dark as well (the baby scene). Ultimately, this is clearly a movie classic that will stand the test of time.",requiemforadream
"One of the most terrifying films I have ever seen, if not the most terrifying. Requiem of a dream takes a deep unpolished dive into the physical and psychological ramifications of drug abuse. This superb film will leave you in utter despair at even the thought of consuming recreational drugs and is a must watch!",requiemforadream
"83%. This movie is a powerful look into the effect of addiction within society, but more importantly ourselves. Yes, we are selfish creatures. Everything, sooner or later, connects back to us, but that is how the movie gets you. On one hand you are deeply saddened for the characters, and more importantly the people who they represent in real life. But on the other hand you see the worst parts of yourself in these characters and realize you must always fight to keep those demons at bay. Aside from the message the movie is unique and is engaging throughout. I can promise you won't be bored, it will make you feel something in someway.",requiemforadream
"Requiem For a Dream proves to be a jarring, unflinching, nightmare that never shies away from the bleak, often haunting and never dull saga of drug addiction. The film doesn a fantastic job of really putting the viewers in the scene and the feelings and emotions jump off of the screen, Well acted by the entire cast, expertly directly, and the soundtrack compliments everything in a superb way. Cinematography is superb and this is shot in many unique quick cut montages that become increasingly erratic and disturbing as the characters slip further into the abyss of addiction, finally reaching a fantastic climax that has the viewers heads spinning. Its hard to say what aronofsky's best work is for me its between, The Wrestler, Black Swan, and Requiem For A Dream, I think in the end Requiem remains a moving, sad, overwhelming and above all lasting example of cinema making an audience feel.",requiemforadream
"Although not for the faint of heart given it's terribly sad subject matter, Requiem for a Dream definitely strikes an emotional chord, introducing us to the problem of addiction in a very dead own manner, and at times making us feel overwhelmed by the pain of the characters.",requiemforadream

Wow this movie is intense! So real! Shows you where drugs and false priorities get you in life. All of the four main characters give out amazing performances! Its one of the best psychological thrillers ever. The editing is something to give credit too. The score is fire!

"Literalmente esta película es como si estuvieras dentro de una montaña rusa por una hora y cuarenta, con una edición espectacular, incluyendo una maravillosa cinematografía, con fantásticas actuaciones de los cuatro actores protagonistas, y una maravillosa dirección artística, debes estar preparado antes de ver la película, porque estas a punto de presenciar una de las películas mas intensas que podrás ver en mucho tiempo",requiemforadream
"The film is pure-gut punch and at times, genuinely hard to watch. This is the ultimate ""scared straight"" film as their is a realism and genuine sadness to all of the story-lines. The score is perfect.",requiemforadream
"This is Darren Aronofsky's 2nd movie. So it made sense for him to tackle a subject like this one near the new millennium. It's his trippy spiral into drug addiction. Jennifer Connelly, Keith David, a young Jared Leto, and I forgot Marlon Wayans was in this. 3 characters; a young couple and an elderly woman begin to feel the rush but also the downside of taking these supplements. 20 years later and it's still a highly styled product of its era, its hopped-up editing schemes and plethora of lens choices and gimmicks a glossy refinement of 90s indie aesthetics and Tarantino-patented extremity. Might not be everyone's taste but it's a creative example of a filmmakers vision. The 1978 novel was grimly forensic in detailing the physical and mental destruction wrought by drug addiction. The movie also has one of the most memorable scores ever. Wonderful performances and such bleak imagery are impressive. Good cutting edge indie filmmaking with its split screen style and extreme closeups. It says we're all vulnerable to some manner of addiction, and legal ones aren't necessarily safer or less ruinous than their underworld counterparts. The movie vividly evokes the sensation of what drugs actually do to your system, briefly for better and mostly for worse, from twitchy initial rush through to comedown and tortured aftermath. It all boils down to just saying no. Aronofsky pushes his limits with this plot and it's probably a good thing he did setting the bar for future storytellers.",requiemforadream
"Difficult to watch but a well-told story and well-made movie. All the main actors do a great job of conveying the slippery slope of drug addiction, even for well-intended reasons. More relevant today with prescription drug addiction on the rise as well as ICE and other drugs. Warning: does not have a happy ending.",requiemforadream
"This movie is SAD. The poor mom left all alone and sinking deeper and deeper into the game show she's watching is really the saddest part, but all of it is miserable and it doesn't really get any better at any point. It's definitely a good movie but in a lot of ways it's too real. 10 stars for really hitting home, minus 5 stars for making me too upset to ever watch it again!!!!",requiemforadream
"There comes a time in everyone's life where they are presented with something that fundamentally shifts their outlook on the nature of mankind. This film is one of those examples. To put it simply, this is a movie about the destructive power of drug abuse. But below the surface, Requiem is so much deeper. This is a film about the depravity of humanity. This is a film about the lengths man will go to when their mind is not right. This is a film that will make you question whether there is hope for the future of the human race. The imagery is visceral beyond anything one could describe. It is one thing to have gruesome physical content, but the true power of this masterpiece comes in the outstanding performances of its cast. Anyone who has struggled with their own mind, even in the slightest of ways, can glean something from this work. It is not for the faint of heart. Be warned: this movie will make you depressed.",requiemforadream
"This is what you get when very talented people decide to do a semi-realistic picture of the WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME for EVERY character in the movie. William Shakespeare's review of this film would probably read, ""Now THAT'S what I call a Tragedy! EVERYONE we care about either dies or faces a horrible future!"" What makes this movie special is LOVE. We, the audience grow to love these characters. They are presented to us as good people. They love each other. There's not a 'bad' person in the crowd. If Ellen Burstyn was your apartment neighbor you would be glad to say hi to her when you saw her in the hall. The teenage protagonist loves his mother and just wants a great life for her. for himself, for his friend, and for his pretty girlfriend. Everybody just LOVES everybody else! If they were selfish arses or just dealing drugs for money, you could think to yourself, ""Well, they got what they deserved!"" But the film's characters DIDN'T get what they deserve. They got WORSE than they deserve. Should your life be ruined forever just for wanting some fun out of life? The mother just wants to be on TV so she can be ""somebody special"" to her friends. Otherwise, without a man, or other interests, she has nothing to live for or look forward to. I believe that all of us know that life just ain't supposed to be like that. The penalty for stepping over the line shouldn't be what ALL of these characters get. I can't stop watching this movie. But I have to tell you that I look away from the screen in some parts. I am silently shouting at the screen, ""No! No! That person does not deserve that! Have mercy on them!"" But in this movie, the quality of mercy IS strained.",requiemforadream
"This film is hard to watch but gripping at the same time. Every teenager should be forced to watch this, its a fantastic antidrug message.",requiemforadream
"Aronofsky shows his touch early in his career; it felt like a sort of sequel to ""Pi,"" with much of the same camerawork, four (instead of one) disturbed characters, and a sort of meandering to an ending that is more message than story. Some of its themes or points are pretty obvious and hit way on the head far too often and too hard; Burstyn's character and story was overly pathetic and not very profound.",requiemforadream
"Almost twenty years old, I'd heard good things about this but never seen it. It's been on my list for awhile, finally clicked with a chance to see it. Starts decent but too much mama boy and his mama drama. Then it starts turning into some truly terrifying shit and you realize this movie is becoming more and more morbidly entrancing with each minute that passes. OH MY GOD! 4 of 5",requiemforadream
Ellen Burstyn is one of the best living actresses and her performance is worth the watch even if the film was way too odd for me.,requiemforadream
"In my opinion, this is Aronofsky's best film, by far. Dark, real, and grim, and featuring a top 3 performance by an actress I've ever seen in Ellen Burstyn.",requiemforadream
"Burstyn is an absolute tour de force in this film, what a transformative performance. Every cast member does a strong turn, but she is the unparalleled standout, accompanied by a major surprise in the form of an unexpectedly good performance from Wayans (who I was unaware had performed in any serious dramas at all). The film's notorious intensity was definitely a driving factor preventing me from seeing this film at some point in the previous two decades, but now having seen it I would describe the film more as exceptionally uncomfortable than unpalatable, gradually building up pressure before ultimately allowing the pot to boil over (characteristic of Aronofsky). The film's take on psychological surrealism and induced delusion is great; parents, don't rely on McGruff the Crime Dog to tell your kids not to do drugs, just show them Requiem for a Dream. (4/5)",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a dream is written and directed by Darren Aronofsky based on the book with the same name written by Hurbert Shelby Jr. This film is the story about 4 individual lives and their addictions. One of them played by Ellen Burstyn gets addicted to diet pills when she is invited on a game show and must slim down in order to fit into a dress she so desperately wants to wear and also to look good. Her son played by Jared Leto who is addicted to a lot of things mainly heroine starts up a business with his girlfriend played by Jennifer Connelly and his best friend played by Marlon Wayans where they get drugs and sell it to make profit. And as the year for each individual drug induced person goes on things start getting worse and worse as the drugs take over their health and life. Requiem for a Dream is one of those films that will never escape me and for whoever watches the film I guarantee that it won't leave the mind as well. Through this entire runtime my eyes were glued to the screen for beginning, middle and end. Once in a while I'd think to myself man I am really invested in this film. This film garners your attention and never lets up. Which is an aspect that I think people might not like but we'll get to that in a little bit. From the incredible pacing I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and never found myself attention-less. Requiem for a Dream is an phenomenal piece of cinema that will go down in film history as possibly one if not the nightmarish and disturbing films ever created. And it is by far one of the best films that I have ever seen. Now that might seem very daunting because of the subject matter of the film but I don't know. Not thinking about that subject matter there's something very intriguing about this film that I can't not stop thinking about. Darren Aronofsky has crafted such a unique and creative tale of misery and sadness that in a way just seems so perfect. The way the story is told and how the editing plays a major part of the film from editor Jay Rabinowitz. Including the shots and cinematography from director Darren Aronofsky and cinematography Matthew Libatique giving the atmosphere of the film its claustrophobic and disturbing experience. From the nightmarish scenes involving their hallucinations to the drugs they take to moments of consequences they have to endear. Also trying not to forget to mention but the fantastic and nerve racking score from Clint Mansell giving the film another bump of adrenaline and absolute menace. This might be my favorite Darren Aronofsky film ever and to be far I haven't seen all of his films yet but man I don't think with an experience like this one will be beaten by any of his other films to tell the truth. He did an amazing job at directing this including writing this. It's very unpredictable there was even a moment in the film after I was halfway through it that I decided I can't predict anything out of this film which is something that I really enjoy from a film. You also get why they do this, they're not just stereotypical junkies, they have motives and reasons why they do the drugs. Which leave me to the performances from our 4 main characters. Right off the bat I'm debating if I like Jared Leto more in this or in Dallas Buyers Club. He was terrific in this film. Jennifer Connelly is an actress I'd like to watch more of because man she was also fantastic in this film as the girlfriend of Jared Leto's character. Marlon Wayans as Jared Leto's best friend was also really great in the film which I didn't expect at all but he did really well. But my favorite performance throughout this film was Ellen Burstyn. Out of all of them I felt more for her than anyone. But not to say that I didn't really feel bad for anyone else, I most certainly felt bad for everyone but Ellen's performance I felt just more sympathetic for. From the beginning and end you can see the drastic change in her after going to far with the drugs she takes which was just heart breaking. There's also one scene where I just thought this is by far one of the best actress acting scenes I have ever seen ever. She was freaking phenomenal in this film. Now for all of them just mentioning it briefly but there is one sequence that had my mouth in ah and could not look away. A sequence that made me realize what an uplifting experience this entire film has been. Coming back to what I mentioned before this film will tear you to pieces with its editing, storytelling and subject matter. Also it's aspect of claustrophobia. And I will be fully understandable if this subject matter is something you or anyone else can't handle. I would never recommend watching this film ever if you feel that way about the subject matter. Trying not to be super dramatic but it's the truth. Darren Aronofsky understands the subject matter and throws his own unique spin on it giving it a very disturbing and very sad experience and is also a film and has also been deemed a film that no one should watch on a second viewing and it's the absolute truth. This is no blockbuster you can watch over and over again and be entertained by, this is a grounded dark tale that will already never leave your mind because of how it is. All in all if you can handle this subject matter I'd watch it for the experience and be done with it. Or if you're like me you might really like it but who knows. And another thing worth noting is this film is not trying to promote addiction. This is a film that a wanna be junkie will watch and probably will never want to do drugs ever. That's how terrifying this film is. Requiem for a Dream is one of the best and one if not the most disturbing and upsetting film I have ever seen in my life and I gonna give it a 10/10. Thank you so much for reading look forward to more reviews very soon.",requiemforadream

"This is the best movie I've ever seen but I will never watch it again. ﻿This is a movie that you can only ever see once. Requiem for a Dream is not a film that you just pop in on any given night. You have to be prepared to watch four characters slowly spin out of control due to drugs. It's really disturbing but in a good way, it makes the viewer think.",requiemforadream
"The cinematic height of a health problematic film that health classes would present as clearly visualized warning about what would drugs do to you is no exaggeration as Darren Aronofsky was headstrong in his disturbingly honest approach that guarantees sickness, to a puking extent if never looked away, and apathy for the hopelessly unlikable characters sealing, or in their cases injecting, their fates from resulted downward spiral of addictions that disregard living. Even though the characters lost their will to live and must suffer the rest of their respective lives as consequences for their horrible, pathetically disgusting addictions, the cast performed well in getting through especially the young trio building up their stardom at the time. Only one communication found common sense through Leto's performance in one scene with words his character should have listened to and additionally become a hypocritical drug addict, which is a brutalized truth that people using drugs are arrogantly ignorant of the dangers posed against their well-beings – and that shows how Aronofsky should've gone further in communication rather than focusing on the depressing spiral. Fairly praiseworthy on the aesthetics through the cinematography and acceptable surrealism despite the discomfort, but how can it be rated into the like if it's not enjoyable? If you ever watch this film, whether nighttime or not, immediately follow it with a more positive film, doesn't matter if it's a good one or a bad one, just to get rid of what your eyes just tasted.

"Yes, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a beautifully made film, and exceedingly well-acted. But in a way, those positively-spun accolades are irrelevant red herrings and tangential false flags. Because the core attribute of ""Requiem for a Dream"" wholly eclipses every other with its pitch-black truth: Sometimes, dreams just don't come true. This is the bleakest film ever made, and there are people who should actively avoid it at all costs. It offers razor blades. Hopelessness. And the promise that if you subject yourself to watching it, you will know too much. There are experiential darknesses that leave scars in life, but they're relegated to real-world experiences -- abuse, torture, addiction, death, grief. In film, only the experience of watching ""Requiem for a Dream"" can mimic in the psyche some of those destructive true life horrors. Consuming it can take things away from you. ""It's just a movie,"" you say. But when you say that, consider the possibility that you say it irresponsibly. The safe play here is to avoid ""Requiem for a Dream,"" and run the other way; the revelations it offers are just too insidious.",requiemforadream
"Aronofsky truly knows how to unsettle me like no other. The amateur aesthetic only adds to the grotesque imagery. It's tough to watch but if you can stomach it, you are in for a wild ride that will stay with you",requiemforadream
A movie that may be a little too intense for some. Very dark. Has some good acting and directing. I felt depressed after watching this.,requiemforadream
Stylistic and bleak. One of the truest depictions of addiction and how it effects your life and the lives of all those around you. Gut-wrenching.,requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream explores the harsh realities of addiction with intense imagery and incredible performances, and although it may be emotionally challenging for some to view, that is simply because it presents the brutal truth.",requiemforadream
"First and foremost, Ellen Burstyn was robbed of an Oscar [again]. This is probably the best anti-drug film ever made. Talk about watching a car-wreck in slow motion. This is the death of hope. The danger of self-delusion. Visually, it would be impossible to be any more in these people's shoes if you tried. It is brilliant. Nauseating. Sad. Horrifying. It is a class in acting. A class in editing. A class in directing. Get ready to be thoroughly depressed and numb.....in the best possible way.",requiemforadream
"I loved the very human aspect of the movie. It wasn't just a preachy story of ""look at these stupid kids doing drugs, don't do it''. It showed the characters' feelings and the different circumstances that make people behave in a way they normally wouldn't. Also, how was Wayans' acting more powerful than Leto's? Who decided it was ok to have that hairstyle and accent? I know the story comes from a book, but still. Jennifer Connelly was perfect in this environment though; pure aesthetic pleasure.",requiemforadream
"Aronofsky paints a brilliantly depressing and sobering picture of the horrors of addiction. The unusual camera style creates a visual roller coaster of the high to the crash. With the opioid crisis in the US out of control, this movie stay relevant 19 years later.",requiemforadream
"Incredible! The best and most f***** up movie I've never seen! Never has a movie made all my senses more aware, and happy and sad! Aronofsky's best!!! One of most bad ass soundtrack!!!",requiemforadream
"Very raw and intense film, definitely not for everyone. However, it's unique editing and storytelling will draw you into this film revolving around the use of drugs. I'm even scared to drink aspirin at this point lol.",requiemforadream
"A movie not for all, but the performance of actress and actors are magnificent. The film represents (based on the book) people's addictions and it's consequences.",requiemforadream
"I knew how this film would end from the get-go, and hoped the characters would have some sort of redemption. I was very disappointed (unless you consider fetal position to be synonymous to redemption). Well shot and directed, but so thin on story that I am sick to my stomach with no takeaway other than ""don't do drugs, kids"".",requiemforadream
"Maaan, what a film it is! I finished it almost now, and this shocked me and said me again and again ""never use drug!"". I have watched lots of men when they using drug. But after spending my time on watching this masterpiece, I am sure I will never use it. This is the pretty valuable ""don't use narcotic/drug"" ad I have seen ever. Actually, I watched lots of films, even show in theatre, but this one is really powerful in its own way. Also can be added that in terms of acting, especially performance of Jared Leto, it is type of the film I would love to rate as 8 star.",requiemforadream
"We got a winner! Wow, my fav film but i will never watch it again. Well i might, only if i want to cry again. Crazy and unforgiving. You will regret watching this, but you must watch it",requiemforadream
Completely extraordinary. A depth detailed look into The life of addiction and What it can do to you. This movie should be taught In school to help avoid drug Abuse.,requiemforadream
"Innovative filmmaking that successfully imposes its tempo and holds your attention until the last second. Mainly using shock value than conventional storytelling, its eerie atmosphere gives a really dark tone to an already dark theme. The four protagonists are the perfect illustration of the ability of addiction to trigger the rapid demise or breakdown of a person's basic components: bodily integrity, mental health, freedom and dignity.",requiemforadream
"Brilliant, shocking, and depressing. The acting is superb and the story is fascinating. But, it is a dark tragedy that some viewers may not be prepared for. I recommend for mature adults; definitely not a family film.",requiemforadream
"Oof. After bursting onto the scene with the bleak and unforgiving directorial debut that was ""Pi,"" Darren Aronofsky followed it up by tapping into the bibliography of author Hubert Selby Jr. and crafting this cinematic equivalent of one basically saying ""you ain't seen nothing yet."" As far as cinematic sack taps go, ""Requiem For A Dream"" isn't necessarily the most severe. But, dear God, is it going to be a massive buzzkill to whatever the hell you had going on in your life. As a visual experience, it is simply exhausting, but it's not all for naught. Many critics cite Aronofsky's provocative filmmaking style to be a bit excessive, if not obvious or lacking in finesse. And though I might find this critique to be true in some cases (i.e. ""mother!""), I think ""Requiem For A Dream"" might be that rare case where I couldn't see any other approach doing the story justice. This is a movie that hits that ""best of both worlds"" zone of provocateur filmmaking, where the product ultimately ends up being unnerving and difficult, yes, but also thought-provoking and called for. Do I ever want to see it again? Not really, no. But, man, did Ellen Burstyn ever deliver a career-defining performance, if I ever saw one.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is not a film that you just pop in on any given night. You have to be prepared to watch four characters slowly spin out of control due to drugs. This isn't a wholesome, the world is great kind of movie. It's painful to watch, but yet it's hard to not get invested in the story and feel curious about how it'll all end. There isn't much about this one to not like. The writing is great, the story is great, and the characters are all very interesting on their own. Oddly, the only thing I had a bit of an issue with was the cinematography. I just wasn't much of a fan of how it was all shot and the overall look of the film, but that's more of a nitpick than anything. Requiem for a Dream is a must watch, even if you can only get through it once.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is co-written and directed by, Darren Aronofsky (Pi) and this film is utterly fantastic. Filled with very intense and thrilling scenes that are emotionally and psychologically tormenting, this film understands the harsh reality of drug abuse. This film has great performances from all the cast members involved, and is truly a masterpiece of psychological cinema.",requiemforadream
"This movie is incredible. The characters are so well written and acted, and the movie is immersive. People usually find this movie depressing, but I found it so captivating, intense, and enjoyable that I didn't feel sad afterwards. I've watched this movie more times than almost any other movie, and it's my 2nd favorite movie. I highly recommend it.",requiemforadream
"A gut-wrenching exploration into drug abuse. Requiem For a Dream delivers a disgusting view of a dark reality no one wants to see, and it reflects it with a perfectly resonant message.",requiemforadream
"This movie is one of these movies that has it all. The plot, cinematography, sound, editing, acting. All of it is great, but what really stands out is the editing. It keeps the viewer in suspense and at the edge of the seat. All of it is beautifully made and it's definitely a movie everyone should see at least once.",requiemforadream
"It's clear that Darren Aronofsky didn't want to make something new and special in the characters' arcs or the story, but he wanted to put you in the shoes of the characters with his creative use of visuals and sounds, and he succeeded.... kinda! Thanks to Aronofsky's direction that harmonized surreal visuals and sounds with the characters' feelings and experiences, I found myself experiencing and feeling what the characters experience and feel while watching the movie. Due to that, this is without a doubt one of the most disturbing and intoxicating movies I've ever watched. The problem is that the dramatic aspect in the movie actually harmed the movie; the dramatic scenes at the end of the first act slowed the pace of the movie down. It's not the only or the major issue I've with this movie. The real issue is that the creative direction that elevated the stereotypical arc of Sara Goldfarb, wasn't enough to do this with the stereotypical arc of Harry and Marion. Also, the oscar-worthy performance by Ellen Burstyn (I really wanna know how she didn't win an oscar) and a few complications in her character, Sara Goldfarb's part was way better and more compelling than Harry and Marion's. I really didn't found myself relate to the characters of Harry and Marion so much, despite the great performances that Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly gave. The perfect example that can affirm that the dramatic aspect wasn't the most powerful thing in the movie is the character of Tyrone; it's a very bland character and it was very hard for me to relate to its subplot, Marlon Wayans was very good though. I love Requiem for a Dream. It's a movie to experience not to watch. It really proves that Darren Aronofsky is a real talent that with his artistic direction can easily mess with your mind. (7.5/10)",requiemforadream
"A film where not much positive happens and that which is positive is probably a drug-fuelled fabrication - yet this is necessary for a realistic portrayal of the terrors of drug addiction, whether illegal or prescribed. an incredible and gut-wrenching film.",requiemforadream
"Wow, what a movie! Jason Bailey, writing for the New York Times, put it best when he wrote this about Requiem for a Dream: ""The hellhole of abusing drugs - from the ""hard stuff"" of heroin to the seemingly harmless likes of diet pills - is brought to blunt, brutal, visceral life in Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of the novel by Hubert Selby Jr. The focus is on three friends in Brighton Beach who soon put their dreams on the back burner in pursuit of the next high, which gives way to the pursuit of the next one, and so on and so on (in increasingly shorter intervals). But the showcase performance here is Ellen Burstyn, who was nominated for an Oscar for her performance as an aging mother who becomes addicted to pills and gets increasingly lost in herself. Pounding and relentless, it's one of the most harrowing movies ever made about the horrors of addiction.""",requiemforadream
"The filming style was very unique and interesting for half of the movie. After a while I felt like I was just watching a long, bad trip. The cinematography was great, captivating fear in every shot without a doubt. However, after a while I become bored of despair. The story was too truthful for my taste; too depressing.",requiemforadream
"One of the best movie about drugs out there! So intense, so grounded, so rough. What it makes it work so well, is the amazing direction and the perfect music of Clint Mansell. A must-see!",requiemforadream
"It's a devastatingly horrific parable of how enslaved we our to addiction. Its symbolic and queasy imagery will stick with you long after the credits roll. It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy cinematic art at its finest, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is right up your alley.",requiemforadream
"""Requiem for a Dream"" has many metaphors about addiction, about our comfortable world, about how depressed we are. It's definitely one of my favorite drugs movies besides Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"". But, I prefer this film than the Boyle masterpiece. It's a harsh movie, a brutal movie, an honest movie. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Wayans, and now, Ellen Burstyn. They are all truly insane supported with such a haunting and beautiful score. Similar to the beauty of an obsession, an art of life. Stylish, honest, yet depressing. The viewing experience is very, very extraordinary but to be honest, I don't want to watch this film again. I just can't afford how terrifying this movie was.",requiemforadream
"A gripping, haunting look at drug addiction that assaults the viewer in the rawest sense of the word by the end. The beginning takes some transitioning after which, Requiem is in constant flux of wild emotions, mania, and torturous intensity that will stick with you long after the credits roll.",requiemforadream
"Just saw this movie in 2018 for the first time. Disturbing yet powerful imagery. Great and believable acting. Do I know what it's like to be addicted to drugs or medications, etc.? No. But if there's something this movie tells me it's to SAY NO.",requiemforadream
"With Darren Aronofsky's latest film Mother starring Jennifer Lawrence arriving in theaters across the country this week, now is the perfect time to look back on the best of Aronofsky's career thus far. You can hear more about Mother and the style of Darren Aronofsky on the next ""Everyone Is a Critic Movie Review Podcast"" available on iTunes every Monday Morning. Darren Aronofsky is driven by an obsession with obsession. His characters are those that are driven past the brink of madness by their obsessions. The math in Pi, the drugs in Requiem for a Dream, love and immortality in The Fountain, to be the best in Black Swan, Piety and to build a boat in Noah, Aronofsky's characters are obsessives who risk everything for their goals no matter how dangerous or wrong-headed those goals may be. ",requiemforadream
Still easily Aronofsky's best film by some distance although I wasn't as blown away by it as when I first watched it 17 years...yes 17 years ago. That piece of music is really overdone and it has dated a little. Anyway setting that aside the central revolving story and the performances (Burstyn and Leto in particular) are brilliant. I haven't read the book (yet) but this feels like a direct and successful translation from the page and the descent into misery for all involved has lost none of it's power.,requiemforadream
"Puntaje Original: 7.5 Darren Aronofsky en todo su esplendor como director. Requiem for a Dream nos cuenta una historia poderosa, visceral, impactante y con una sincera, profunda y crítica visión hacia el extremismo de las adicciones humanas. Brillantes actuaciones y un estilo visual despampanante.",requiemforadream
"Alguns filmes não divertem, apenas incomodam. A edição acerta muito nesse sentido. A personagem de Ellen Burstyn conquistou minha empatia. Para mim, Requiem For a Dream valeu a pena por causa dela.",requiemforadream
"Requiem For A Dream: Afronosky showcases his talent for filmaking with bleak imagery, excellent preformances and a uncomfortable, daring, and depressing story, that is to much for some.",requiemforadream
An amazing movie. The acting is simply amazing. The thing that got me was the cinematography. During Ellen Burstyn's drug scene the camera work was so dramatic. It made it unforgettable. The movie was just amazing through and through.,requiemforadream
"What an astonishing piece of work. ""Requiem for a Dream"" is one of my favorite films of all time, a disturbing and horrifying tale of four people destroying their lives in their pursuit of happiness and success. Through the subjective camerawork and unique editing style, writer-director Darren Aronofsky lets us delve into the mental state of these four characters, what they see, feel, and fear. Incredible performances throughout (Ellen Burstyn delivering one of the most unforgettable performances ever put in history of cinema) and packed with some dark imagery that sticks with you long after you finish the film. It's not for everyone and calling it a drug movie is doing disservice to what the film is actually about. It's deeper and more complex than that. It grabs you by the wrist and never lets go. What a great film.",requiemforadream
"While the quality of the way this story was told was high, but this was also one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen. The disturbing factor went a bit too far, otherwise I would have rated this film higher",requiemforadream

"10/10 Requiem for a dream is the most intense movie I've ever seen, every single actor in this movie is amazing, but the best of them all is Ellen Burstyn, although Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly offered one of the best performances I ever Seen,Ellen Burstyn gives the best emotion acting I've ever seen , everything u can think of a movie, now think of a movie that does that everything that u can think of a movie right, u got this movie. It's perfect. the score and the events that take place keep ur heart pounding the whole time , this is not for the faint hearted as there are imagery and scenes that are very well done, so well done as it is a psychological horror that stick to ur mind, it's so friggin intense, this is not a heartwarming family movie at all , this is a film that challenges u and makes u sweat all over,every scene with Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb is so intense I don't even wanna see it, it's so effective it makes u scream from the insides,Ellen is so good u think of her character as the main one, although there should be no main character in this drama, The only flaws are the opening credits, and Marlon Wayans feel inferior as everyone is so good",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is a legitimate cinematic nightmare that takes viewers on a devastatingly real spiral into full-blown drug addiction. At times hard to watch, but even harder to forget, the film's pitch-perfect performances and spellbinding visual storytelling make it Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream (2000), directed by Darren Aronofsky, kind of makes you wonder about the filmmaker's past, and just what spurred him to make a movie as dark and depressing as this. It practically screams ""Don't do drugs, kids!"" but it does so in the artsy kind of way that keeps you enthralled and never even approaches the area of preachy. In fact, it just makes you downright scared of addiction. Ranging from three of the seasons, summer to fall to ultimately winter, the film represents how the characters' lives get darker and colder with each season that progresses. Obviously, summer being the brightest and warmest, and winter being the darkest and coldest. Addiction is a real thing, and throughout the film, you'll see through Aronofsky's eyes the kind of effects it can (will) have on you. Throw in a beautiful, melancholy score, and you get a touching motion picture that you'll never forget. I can actually hear the Lux Aeterna melody as I write this, but that's probably because I'm listening to it right now. Requiem for a Dream hosts four main characters, Ellen Burstyn as Sara Goldfarb, a more serious than normal Marlon Wayans as Tyrone, Jennifer Connelly as Marion, and Jared Leto as Harry Goldfarb, who has ties with each of the other three characters (mother, friend, girlfriend). Each of them is or will become addicted. And each of them meets different, yet terrible, fates in the end. Ellen Burstyn brings the character of Sara Goldfarb to life so well that it makes me never want to grow old. Starting out as a sweet, (if a little kooky) lonely old woman, her quest to become beautiful again for her game show appearance that she can't wait for causes her to become addicted to diet pills, and everything in her life spirals out of control from there. This film is not for everyone. If you'd rather watch a feel-good movie where the protagonist(s) prevail and everybody is happy in the end, you should probably stay away from Requiem for a Dream. Everyone else - come into this movie with an open mind and just enjoy the ride (if that's the correct phrase) that Aronofsky is about to take you through.",requiemforadream
"The feeling I felt at the end of the film was the most absolute sadness, for having witnessed a tragedy so announced and at the same time so inevitable. Because ""Requiem for a dream"" is this: a hard and sad movie, as if someone punched him in the stomach. A precise mixture of despair and melancholy, which shows that we should rather dream, but that we must also be aware that no dream is worth it if it is to be achieved that we simply have to sell our soul. A great movie!",requiemforadream
"It's not a horror movie, but it's one of the most unsettling movies I've ever seen. The style that this film has is also incredible and unique, I really praise he second short segments shot during the drug taking scenes. The acting is also extremely powerful. This is a movie that likes to fuck with your mind, and it's by far the scariest, most disturbing non-horror movie I've ever seen, which is why it's so good. The score is also very eerie and haunting. Overall, it may not have the age yet to become a classic, but when it does, it's gonna be one hell of a classic. Recommended for sure !!",requiemforadream
"One of the most powerful movie's and real life experience you'll have, especially if you never been around drug addiction. Great set of cast and tremendously well acted. Personal top 10 movies ever. Must watch.",requiemforadream
Today I watched my cat take a dump in the yard. He spent a solid 3-5 minutes trying to bury it. I walked over and it wasn't even close to being sprinkled with dirt and grass. And it smelled really bad. Watching my cat shit in the yard and unsuccessfully bury it was better than watching requiem for a dream,requiemforadream
"Moral of the story - don't do drugs kids. I say that cynically of coarse. But the fact is that these characters stories could happen to anyone and probably has happened to some people, sadly. On a less negative note, I think Ellen Burstyn's performance was phenomenal. I think she deserves every Emmy every award, ever accolade possible for what she achieved in this movie. Fantastic performance. Overall, great film with very disturbing themes and a genuine Aronofsky experience. One time watch I think.",requiemforadream
"Horrifying, fascinating, and visceral. Disgusting and depressing without being a tired slasher or cliché horror film. Practically indescribable, and the only way to understand my rating is to see it. Not suitable for most people, however-the intimate dive into the depths of drug addiction and subsequent insanity are too much for some to stomach.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is not an easy watch. I am desensitise to most things but even I winced a couple of times when watching this. This makes Trainspotting look like the Teletubbies in terms of its horribly graphic depiction of drugs. Four of the best combined performances in modern cinema help that. Jared Leto is scarily convincing, Ellen Burstyn is almost traumatising to watch, Jennifer Connelly is also worrying because of how good she is and Marlon Wayans is terrific as well, he should have done more serious films, he is a great actor. He stole most of the scenes he was in. The colour pallet in this film is also genius. Everything is very dull, like their lives apart from the few things that bring them joy, like the red dress. Having one of the most iconic movie scores of all time helps too.",requiemforadream
"Difficult to watch, but necessary. A drug movie that looks at different forms of addiction, aging, and loneliness. Pacing slips a little towards the end.",requiemforadream
"Clever, but I didn't like it. I'm sure it follows in the same vein as Trainspotting. A movie I have yet to see. Or want to. Too many scene splicing montage action, and heavy with the chaos of several characters experiencing intense endeavors.",requiemforadream
"This movie embodies the bleakness of being young without money or prospects, while also being representative for being old, insecure and lonely. I loved every single second of it.",requiemforadream
"A very sad, and perhaps stereotypical view of the drug world, but overall I felt connected to the characters. Some great acting, and definitely gives you a rush, although the comedown is a little bleak. maybe that was the point. overall I liked it, but a re-watch isn't necessary ... but I probably will, if I get the craving .",requiemforadream
"This shocking film tell us a story about people, who want their wishes come true. They can pay a lot to get this what they want.",requiemforadream
"Great movie, but one you will not bear to watch again. However, the film is spectacularly directed and will stay with you for a long time after the credits roll.",requiemforadream
"Amazing film. The cast does a great job especially Ellen Burstyn, its directed and edited perfectly, and the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. It's haunting and disturbing, but impossible to look away from. It's basically the ultimate anti drug movie.",requiemforadream
"Visceral, inventive, hallucinatory, and downright terrifying. Darren Aronofsky has made something that is objectively compelling. This is strong Gen X filmmaking that also plays host to one of the strongest performances of modern cinema: Ellen Burstyn's transformative performance as Sara Goldfarb. It's a masterpiece with purposeful hip-hop music video energy about age, addiction, greed, and empty, desperate clawing toward status. The characters in this cautionary tale all begin with focused gaze and perseverance, which devolve into a nightmare of sin, evil, and shame.",requiemforadream
Emotionally disturbing but filled with excellent performances. Requiem For A Dream is a terrifying and realistic look at the scary mind of a drug addict that will get deeply under your skin until the last frame of this film.,requiemforadream
"Pretty Good = 3.5/5 Though I found it hard to watch at times, due to the sick and uneasy feeling it constantly left in my stomach, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a very well made, thought provoking film, with some fantastic performances by its cast.",requiemforadream
A pretty good movie but the farther you get into it the more exaggerated and unrealistic it becomes. I don't know if that was what the director was going for or if he just doesn't know much more about the subject matter than what he has read in newspapers and sitcoms. It just seems like the closest he's been to drugs or users is about three degrees of separation.,requiemforadream
"This is a great film. The first 45 minutes is quite shot, but after that this film is amazing! Very weird film but loved it!",requiemforadream
"Oh boy... Oooooooh boy... Requiem for a Dream is an exercise in how miserable can you make your audience without making them want to walk out, and it does that, fairly flawlessly. This Darren Aronofsky tragedy succeeds through strong writing, directing and powerful performances from an ensemble cast. Requiem For A Dream follows four Manhattan Beach characters; the son played by Jared Leto, (Dallas Buyers Club), his grandmother played by Ellen Burstyn, (The Exorcist, Interstellar), his girlfriend played by Jennifer Connely, (A Beautiful Mind, Blood Diamond), and his best friend played by Marlon Wayans, (White Chicks, Scary Movie). It follows them as they each build up their hopes and dreams, only to have it torn back down again by their own personal addictions. It's like Of Mice and Men on speed, literally, and good. I pitch this film to everyone as a must see, it's a film you should definitely see once, and then never again! It's based on a book by Hubert Selby Jr. who co-wrote the screenplay with Aronofsky, (Black Swan, The Wrestler), a writer famed for his understanding of that sort of low life New York culture and his skill in portraying it, and that really comes through in the film which is scuzzy beyond belief. The dialogue and syntax and slang of the characters really sell them as being in this world, an the grungy lighting, and subtly but meticulously crafted frames help. Subtle beauty, maybe Ang Lee can learn a thing or two. The reason Requiem For A Dream works so well is that before it tears them down, it builds up your relationship with the characters, gets you to empathise with them and feel for them and like them, it builds up their hopes and makes their dreams seem wonderfully possible before their falls. In fact that's literally the structure of the film, which is simple but genius, the three acts are denoted by the seasons; summer, fall, and winter. Our associations with each word complimenting the acts. This character involvement would't work if it wasn't for a collection of quite outstanding performances. Leto's accent is a bit ropey but you get used to it and he does everything else really well. There's one scene with a phone call that I nearly cried watching. I wanted to. Wayans gives an uncharacteristically serious performance and he does it really well. When people were wondering why on earth the man behind all these shit parody movies was being invited to join the American Academy I remembered Requiem For A Dream in which he is charismatic and empathetic. The real stand out though, is Elen Burstyn, who was actually Oscar nominated for this movie and boy does she deserve it. By far the most complex character she gives a powerhouse performance in which she is believable but just extraordinarily brittle. Again, there's a scene where Leto comes to visit that's by far the most memorable scene in the film and again I nearly welled up. In the end it's moments like those that are the key to understanding the hypnotic, mesmeric, enigmatic attraction of Requiem For A Dream, it has a lot of bleak imagery, and montages that will leave you traumatised but it's interspersed with moments of pathos and emotional sadness that are much more subtle and give the more traumatic sequences weight that without it would just seem gratuitous, and worse, slightly immature, using these images without any understanding of the weight they carry. However, luckily, Aronofsky and Selby Jr. know exactly what they're doing and they do it well. It's carried off with a style, professionalism and maturity that belies that this is only Aronofksy's second film, and first bigger budget one. Also, I have to mention Clint Mansell's beautiful, melancholy but perversely techno-influenced score, it's truly amazing.",requiemforadream
Wow! Ellen Burstyn was robbed of the Oscar! Most amazing performance I have ever seen! This is the best work Jennifer Connelly has done. Leto and Wayans are equally good! This movie is a touching and terrifying look at how drugs can take over lives and how quickly can destroy them. This is a rollercoaster ride with a knockout ending. Hang on to your seats.,requiemforadream
"Okay. I get it. Don't do drugs. However, this movie is so much more than that. Aside from its very dark material, it is a joy to watch. I suppose only someone into the film-making style would agree with me, but ""Requiem For A Dream"" keeps a relenting pace that only grows stronger as it progresses, and my eyes can never turn away. While the subject matter is extremely somber, there is a jovial essence that is quite abundant. How masterful to make a film so strong in its message and to also have it resonate in your bones afterwards. It's not a wake up call, it's your surprise birthday party disguised as an intervention.",requiemforadream
"Con uno stile unico e scene esplicite e crude, Requiem for a Dream è un film con una visione strettamente pessimistica: il regista Darren Aronofsky sceglie una storia che non presenta neanche la minima luce di speranza, ed il risultato è commovente e difficile da dimenticare.",requiemforadream
"The best film in the world, the editing , sound, the cinematography, the acting the sound track its all just brilliance and truly masterpiece in every aspect of great film making. Something very eye opening.",requiemforadream
"Heart-stopping, gut-wrenching, breath-taking bravura. Drugs are a hellhole. This film exposes that, and the painful emptiness underneath the surface. See it and feel its effect. Let it transform you in a way few films can.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is maybe one of the most depressing and heart breaking movies in the history of cinema, featuring an old woman, who starts doing drugs to fight back her addiction to chocolate and sweets and attend her favorite TV show unsuccessfully, whose son is a junkie like his best friend and his girlfriend. The movie is divided in three parts: -SUMMER, where the characters are introduced, and where Aronofsky gives the audience hope about the future of them. The love between Harry and Marion is particularly exalted, like Sara's typical widow's way to live. All the main characters underestimate their addiction to drugs as they reach their top. -FALL, where everything start crumbling. Drugs take control over everyone's life. -WINTER, aka the saddest part of the movie. Not crying is a challenge at this point, as Arronofsky great technique to create a link to all the characters makes you feel like you are part of their lives. The movie is not perfect at all, as it features a really poor character's design, an overall repetitive pacing before the latter part, a sometimes confusing photography, but has a strong and perfect soundtrack (one of the most famous in the world), a great plot and is just so entertaining, you sometimes forget to be seeing a DVD. With Trainspotting, this is the best ""don't do drugs"" movie ever, although I wouldn't recommend it to weak people as it may be one of the less enjoyable experience ever.",requiemforadream
"Powerful, unforgettable, and absolutely heartbreaking, Requiem For A Dream finds Darren Aronofsky at his best, pulling out spectacular performances from Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, and Jennifer Connelly, sending out a warning about the dangers of drugs and modern media.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream holds the psychological depth expected of an Aronofsky work, but unlike other films I've seen of his, this one feels empathetic and hopeful. During the Summer chapter of the movie, we truly believe that the characters may have a future, but come Winter, all hope is lost in one of the most effectively depressing and sobering scenes in all of cinema. Requiem, while not the most adult movie I've seen, is certainly inappropriate for younger audiences--yet, that is not the reason I might hesitate to recommend it. The ending is truly unsettling and saddening, and left me in a state of introspection and loneliness.",requiemforadream
"This film is the quintessential drug movie. Skip the D.A.R.E program and just watch this. Amphetamines, Benzodiazepines, Cocaine & Opiates; this mix may not kill you but it's certainly going to try. The drama here revolves around the relationships of these friends and family. Altogether another fantastic film but yet again not journey for the weak at heart. This one will leave the boldest of the bunch; pale in the face. It's a visual spectacle as well; for Aronofsky to try such rapid edit techniques and experimental camera work at the time (2002) was truly avant guard. His next visual leap can be witnessed in 2006's The Fountain. Yet another of his signature films, intense and graphic. The performances here though are ahead of their time and the initial NC-17 rating will keep many from viewing.",requiemforadream
"Arronofsky seems more focused on mortifying the audience than telling a good story with his disturbing images and idiot plot narrative. The characters act so stupidly, whatever sympathy we have for them is completely eradicated by the end. Dark, disgusting and overall, bad. I do not recommend.",requiemforadream
"This was thoughtful and well done, but I felt this movie was too unrealistic. Worth watching, but it's a fairly whitewashed depiction of heroin addiction. Then again, who would watch it if it wasn't?",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a dream is a really good film. Darren Aronofsky utilizes some very interesting directing methods which makes the film unique and makes it stand out from other movies of the same genre. The actors are fantastic in their respective roles and the movie has some pretty intense sequences that make it stick with you hours after the film ends. Some parts of the film feel out of place, though, and some characters do some really absurd things that make the viewer not empathize with them and their decisions.",requiemforadream
"If displaying the consequences of a life of drugs was the agenda, this was accomplished. If making an entertaining movie was the agenda not so much.",requiemforadream
"What a trip. What a fucked up, disturbing, ugly, colourless, gritty, painful, numbing experience. But it was worth it. There is nothing, there is no movie that feels like an experience more than this one, and it's so goddamn real. And the fact that it's sixteen fucking years old... It's heartbreaking, it's painful, it's depressing, it's real. It's real. It feels so real. The movie really depressed me. It really brought me to just thinking low and sad. It's not a movie for the faint of the heart, if you're not ready (I wasn't ready for this movie when I watched it), yeah, don't watch it. But it's incredible. I hated myself for watching it but I don't regret watching it at all. How Ellen Burstyn got robbed of an Oscar is beyond me.",requiemforadream
"This movie conveys the feelings of anxiety and paranoia so incredibly well that it's hard to say that this movie is enjoyable. However, the imagery is powerful and quite successful in achieving its purpose of exposing the horrors of addiction. So while I wouldn't say I enjoyed watching this movie, I'm glad that I did.",requiemforadream
Masterful filmmaking. Every scene just has such a good rhythm. Requiem For a Dream is full of creative and original ideas. Its extremely uncomfortable but this film has purpose and artistry. Thank God for Darren Aronofsky,requiemforadream
One of the most devastating and visually impactful films ever made. Sticks with you forever. Cried my eyes out after barely blinking through the end credits.,requiemforadream
"Never before have I seen a film (or anything for that matter) that has shown the harsh realities of the drug world. If you don't want your kids to do drugs, then you should show them this movie.",requiemforadream
"Whilst it borders on becoming a little too 'MTV' (what that means makes sense to me, at least), 'Requiem For A Dream' has more than enough gusto and originality to get away with its endlessly dark and moody storytelling. The performances are strong, though no one really stood out- likely because of the majority of the film's subdued nature. However, when it does build up Burstyn delivers something memorable and fascinating. Really, it was Sara Goldfarb's story that kept me engaged and interested here and I think it easily made up for some of the film's weaker points. It would be very easy for a film taking itself this seriously to be nothing but a complete joke and whilst, this possibly comes somewhat close at times, it never actually ends up there and I think that's a credit to Aronofsky's direction- this isn't a film trying to be cool, it's just legitimately cool at times. The way he captures frantic addictive tendencies is a real technical achievement and it makes up for some of the script's, quite generic, interpretations of these same concepts. Deserving of its cult status but still just a little too nineties if we're being honest (though I believe it's technically a film of the noughties but, facts are irrelevant).",requiemforadream
"Watching Requiem For a Dream was an experience with lasting effects. It's the most hopeless film I've seen to date with a completely ruthless portrayal of drug addiction and the horrors associated. This is not as much due to the subject matter, but more so to how the characters' struggles are so sympathetic, and these struggles being presented with such scrutiny by Darren Aronofsky and the cast that is devastatingly painful to watch. There is an unwavering sense of disgust from the opening scene, and it never lets up from there, making it the only film that I can confidently say I wanted to squirm in my seat while watching. It is an upsetting film in every sense of the word, made apparent by the emotional performances, the characters' goals in life slowly slipping through their fingers (hence the title) due to their use of drugs, and the uncomfortably close camera angles that give the viewer a cringe-inducing sense of entrapment. It's easy to think of this film before seeing it and assume it is purely dependent on the significance of the subject matter with no substance from a filmmaking standpoint. However, if the film lacked in filmmaking, it would not be nearly as upsetting. Darren Aronofsky knows how to trap the viewers into the horrible events with a stellar cast, Clint Mansell's haunting score, and an unwavering sense of dread. This dread is made possible by how the characters are crafted. Watching them abandon dignity, hold onto false hope, and stomach such disturbing situations made me almost struggle to stay seated, a feat no other film has accomplished. One cannot talk about this film without mentioning Ellen Burstyn's performance. She is tied with Essie Davis in The Babadook for my favorite performance by an actress. What they do so well is make the viewers feel such pity for their miserable lives with performances so convincing that it's easy to forget that they are actors. Although Burstyn outshines everyone else, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, and Jennifer Connelly are fantastic in their roles, doing what Aronofsky most definitely expected them to do: Make the audience feel their characters' pain. As well as the performances, what Aronofsky does technically is equally astounding. Whether a director can add more layers to the story than what is on paper is what separates a mediocre director from a great one, and Aronofsky proves himself to be the latter. Aronofsky uses the same editing technique each time a specific character takes a specific drug, for instance. As the viewer counts the times the technique is used, they feel more and more despair as the characters addictions become gradually stronger. *****SPOILERS FOLLOW***** Where his technical skills really shined for me was the final scene where he wraps up the film perfectly. He shows a montage of our characters laying down, and provides so much with this one directorial choice. All characters except that of Jared Leto assume the fetal position. My interpretation of this is that it's a gesture of despair, conveying a similarity between them. The position also indicates that they are clutching the one thing that helps them take their mind off their new unbearable lives. The reason Harry (Jared Leto) does not assume the position is that he has nothing to hold on to. Every other character does, but the thing that gives them hope is what makes each character arc distinct from the others. Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) clutches the thought of his mother, making him the most hopeful character since he is being forcefully held from his drugs and still has thoughts of a peaceful life. Although the movie shared a theme with Trainspotting in conveying the frightful easiness of slipping into addiction with the story of Sara (Ellen Burstyn), Darren Aronofsky himself said that Tyrone is the only character with hope of escape. Marion (Jennifer Connelly) is similar in that she has something that gives her hope, but different in that she has completely abandoned her life. She curls herself around the heroin she went to such desperate measures to get her hands on, showing how drugs are her salvation from her new life even though they are the cause. The film concludes with perhaps the most depressing character arc in the movie, which is that of Sara Goldfarb. Solidifying the heart-breaking monologue she gives earlier, the thing she holds on to is the fantasy of appearing on television. She knows this will never happen, but the thought of it comforts her. Within this fantasy, her son Harry is implied to have married his girlfriend Marion and appears well-dressed and happy. Him and his mother tell each other they love each other, and the film fades to its end credits. What makes this character arc the most depressing out of all of the others is that her son's life and their relationship being healthy is within the fantasy of her appearing on television. This suggests that her son loving her and vice versa is just as outlandish as her television fantasy. That notion is emphasized further by Sara smiling, but tears running down her eyes can be seen. The way Aronofsky presented the film's wrap-up is the major highlight of his directorial talents within this movie. He knew to convey more ideas visually than what is shown through dialogue and the actors' performances, making this movie's presentation of the subject matter all the more complex. Although it is a film that had me emotionally drained long after seeing it, I cannot deny that it is excellently crafted.",requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is dark and grim, yes. But it's an important film that will linger in your memory for years to come. It's frenetic editing and pace is sublime, and has some of the best performances of each actor's career. A true masterpiece.",requiemforadream
"Anyone who has a history with substance abuse will find this movie very disturbing. What starts off as a glorification of use, suddenly takes a 180, erases any feelings of nostalgia that you felt, and replaces it with fear, sadness, and remorse. Depending on the severity of your history with substance abuse, this movie will punch you in the gut, then kick you in the nads, and then torture you with the realities and eventual outcomes of addiction. In a sense, this story could be a blueprint for the degenerate gambler, the alcoholic, and even to a degree, the tragedies of mental illness (ie the gut-wrenching fight between yourself and your mind; the deterioration of sanity). If any of this is applicable to you, I'm really rooting for you and your happiness. I hope this film proves to be more of a stark reminder re the your past, vs a snapshot of what you're experiencing.",requiemforadream
"Where a visual treat, and a very disturbing tale about the murky drugged underworld (both legal and illegal). It leaves several gaps that are strange even by Aronofsky standard. That being said, you'll find yourself having to remind yourself to breathe occasionally as certain tensions successfully keeps you on edge throughout.",requiemforadream
"Unlike other reviewers who rate movies subjectively with their feelings, I rate this movie five stars objectively based on the quality of the storytelling, direction, acting, music, and camera work. All five of these elements were top notch. Was the movie difficult to watch? Yes. Did I want to curl up into the fetal position and hug my mother afterwords? Oh yes. Ellen Burstyn's performance of an amphetamine-addicted middle aged single mother that degenerates into drug-fueled insanity is perhaps the greatest acting Performance I've ever witnessed and will haunt me forever. The Academy robbed her at the Oscars by giving it to Julia Roberts for Erin Brokovitch. One of the worst Oscar snubs, in my opinion. I'm sure the Oscar voters that year could have used a dose of objectivity themselves.",requiemforadream
"This is a film that has really grown on me with repeat viewing. It's certainly not easy going, but it's a remarkable adaptation of Selby's novel ... really capturing the sense that the seeds of these character's downfall have been planted even before the story begins. It makes the small moments of hope all that more poignant. I think there are really only three serious missteps. It's a mistake to have nominally updated the story's setting to the present day since several aspects of the plot only really make sense in the context of the book's early 70's time frame. While the film is stylish, it's also generally realistic and believable in tone, which makes the excessiveness of the Ellen Burstyn's hallucinations in one key scene stand out as too much. Finally, while Marlon Wayans is good in this (can that be said of ANY other movie he's in), his character is brutally underdeveloped.",requiemforadream
"A very disturbing but yet engrossing look at how drugs can turn someone's life to rock bottom. I really loved how the film continually moved from each of the four characters slowly faster and faster, until the finale was a whirlwind of flashes of them struggling to survive, leaving an impression on me that will not soon be forgotten. The acting was great, Marlon Wayans gives the best performance I've ever seen from him and Jared Leto was really good too. The director used a bunch of really cool camera effects that were fun to look at and didn't distract from the message the film was sending. Requiem for a Dream is a really harsh look at drug addiction, but I would consider it necessary viewing",requiemforadream
In my top 3 for best films ever seen. One of the first films to make feel emotions I never felt before and I will defend that to my grave.,requiemforadream
"Powerful doesn't even describe how I felt upon viewing Requiem for a Dream. Jared Leto continues to amaze me, Marlon Wayans shocked me with a dramatic performance and Jennifer Connelly shines. Darren Aronofsky takes us on journey that will leave you in tears, depressed and amazed. Verdict: buy with confidence",requiemforadream
"Personally being someone who has struggled with addiction for a long time, I am always drawn towards movies that broach the subject of addiction. When talking amongst other addicts about movies on this subject, usually Requiem for a Dream is everyone's favorite, for being so realistic and in your face. But just cause something is realistic does not mean it is automatically going to make a great feature length film. Jared Leto is really good in this movie portraying the role of the drug addict very authentically. Just his physical look alone. The soundtrack is downright disturbing and matches the subject matter perfectly. It is funny though, most people will say the standout performance in Requiem is from Ellen Burstyn, I disagree, I think Leto takes the cake for this movie. The mother's descent into addiction due to a fascination that she is going to be on a television show and must lose weight becomes really disturbing and almost annoying by the end of the movie. This is a movie that you feel like you need to take a shower after you watch it, because you feel so dirty. Yes it is a very authentic movie when it comes to addiction, but a tad over the top if you ask me, if they cut out some of the more disturbing things, I think this movie really would have been better, but that's just me. I would not recommend this to the average movie fan.",requiemforadream
"This is a really hard movie to review. At one end, it is a very dark realistic film about addiction, with great performances from all involved. On the other end, it is one of those movies that is so disgusting and disturbing that its hard to watch but also hard to take your eyes off of. The best way to describe this movie is, you feel like you need to take a shower after you watch it. Being a former addict myself, someone who knows all too well about the depths addiction can take you to, I find the movie very realistic but also a bit overblown. Some parts I feel like I can relate to and other parts I just feel are put in there for shock value. It has a very dark and slow deliberate pace as do most of Aronofsk's films. But overall I would not go out of my way to recommend this movie to the average movie watcher.",requiemforadream
"Be prepared for one of the most violent nightmares imaginable, back in a time when, Aronofsky, was more than capable of smashing your teeth in with a hammer for over an hour. Requiem is the chilling tale that surrounds 4, drug addicted human beings, who are all connected. It documents the progression of the rise and fall of drug addiction, showing the glamorous highs and the frightening lows, highlighting the extremes people will go to, in order to get their next fix. In Aronofsky's second outing, he manages to craft a film so unique and arresting, its almost impossible to look away, despite the horror unfolding on screen. Led by an all star cast, Jennifer Connelly, Marlon Waynes, Jared Leto and Ellen Burstyn, Aronofsky lobs his characters into the depths of hell and then for good measure throws us, the audience, in after them. Shot in a stylish but very rough looking demeanor, Requiem may fool you into thinking your about to witness the same old drug related tale, however the script soon pole vaults into another world, full of dreams and aspirations, demands and exceptions, Aronofsky isnt afraid to tackle some difficult subject matter here, really getting into the meat off all 4 characters downfalls and its harrowing to watch. His quick cut and ominous style becomes a staple of normality straight off the bat and paces the film wonderfully. Requiem doesnt feel bloated, nor does it ever grind to a halt, its constantly on the move, utilizing sound and a blistering soundtrack from Clint Mansell and The Kronos Quartet, to its full advantage. The film weaves in and out of normality, using a wide array of visual techniques, in order to disorientate the audience, which by the finale will have you feeling like you, yourself are coming off a year long drug binge. It's horrible and gritty, intense and creative, stylish and violent to such an extent, Requiem should come with a viewer discretion advised sticker. One of cinema's rare treats, that gets under your eyelids and stings for the duration of its stay, a must own, however approach with caution.",requiemforadream
Hou will need several reality checks especially at the climax of the film. One of the most entertaining movies that is able to make you feel terrible. Not a feel good movie. and not a family movie. But this movie sets out what it attempts to do. To make a psychological thriller that will leave you thinking about it for the remainder of your week.,requiemforadream
"Requiem for a Dream is excellent in terms of acting, directing, score. It is the type of film I'd like to rate as five stars but too many mistakes were made. There were many useless scenes (e.g. ice cream stand with the cop) and the end was far overwrought. Instead the time would have been better spent developing the Tyrone character more. Overall, the work is very talented but also amateurish. Like the culture it portrays, Requiem for a Dream is a mixture of flaws and flashes of brilliance.",requiemforadream
"Watch it once, and you become ""addicted""! Oh, the irony. A masterpiece coupled with one the most powerful soundtracks the music industry has ever witnessed.",requiemforadream
"It's not a great movie, but it is a good one. This film is really going to stick in my head though despite its flaws and lack of cohesion or character development. If I had to describe this film in just one sentence, I would say it is a symbolic clash between our own consuming desires and the harsh reality that comes with the consequences of what we may be wiling to do to achieve ""happiness"". I am serious though...I don't think I can watch this film again. The last 15 minutes literally gave me a nervous breakdown. I mean, it was heavy, Doc! The acting was superb, the cinematography/editing/camerawork was absolutely suiting to the message of addiction and harmful desire that it was hoping to convey, and the soundtrack was beautifully intense. Although this movie is no masterpiece, it is also a film you WILL NEVER forget. I feel psychologically violated.",requiemforadream
"Overrated garbage just like the other Darren Aronofsky films I've seen. A large potion of this film is quick cuts of random things shown in fast motion. It's not art, it's random bullshit. The one positive thing I can say is that performers weren't bad. Otherwise, this movie is a screwed up, depressing waste of time.",requiemforadream

E o elenco, mesmo Marlon Wayans, é excelente, principalmente Ellen Burstyn.",requiemforadream

This movie grabs your attention with masterful directing and editing, then throws you into the downward spiral of the destruction drugs can inflict on you. The acting is powerful, the imagery is disrurbing, and the tone is set brilliantly by its amazing score. The final 15 minutes are some of the most intense and heartbreaking scenes ever filmed.

"Requiem for a Dream is the movie that made me decide once and for all I would not do drugs. Surrounded by many movies like it such as Trainspotting and The Basketball Diaries, this is the only one that genuinely both moved and disturbed me. It is a tough watch but definitely a movie that all people (with strong stomachs) should check out. This movie shows drug addiction through stories about a widowed woman, played to perfection by Ellen Burstyn, her son Harry, a great Jared Leto, his girlfriend Marion, a good Jennifer Connelly, and his best friend Tyrone, a spectacular Marlon Wayans at his best. All of these characters have a view of happiness that they are all trying to reach but addiction is getting in the way of them reaching it. All of the performances are off the charts. Every one in this movie gives it their all and it shows. The writing is great the dialogue is spot on. The direction is perfect from Darren Aronofsky, he really know how to make the audience feel like they are on drugs, and the cinematography is chilling, bleak, and perfect. And the score, oh my god the score, is so perfect and disturbing and fitting for this film. The sound track alone will give you chills. It really is one if the best soundtracks of all time in my opinion. Requiem for a Dream is a dark disturbing tale that is not for people who are bothered by strong depictions of addiction. It makes drugs not look fun for a change. It makes you not want to do them, which it was meant to do. This movie is great, and I have no flaws with it.",requiemforadream
"Begins in search of pleasure and happiness and end up in having momentary bliss that has very dreadful consequences, the concept of Drugs always has the exiting stories to tell with attractive narrative pattern of awesome beginning to the awful ending, drugs intoxicates our body gradually that never let us to live properly or die happily, the obsession for such substances has very huge negative impact on an individual, 2000's 'Requiem for a Dream' is the master class work on drugs and drug addiction that perfectly showcases the overall effects and symptoms of the drug both physical and the social impacts. This movie clearly shows the self punishing act by slow poisoning our self with drugs, this film shows the unintentional attempt of the human towards self destruction. 'Requiem for a Dream' has very good narrative pattern that moves so effectively presenting the materials to its viewers and most specifically some extraordinary technical works in cinematography and editing had given the excellent impactive touch to the work, the scene of delusions by Sara, Harry's disintegrated journey that dilapidate his life, Marion's cravings makes her to end her life into the unpleasant and unwanted acts of guilt, every characters has been designed with each specific distinct traits of its own, Burstyn is the actual superstar of this flick she has rendered very wonderful performance as the diet buff, her expressions are very fantastic, Jarred and Jennifer had made the good act and gave justice to their role, the rapid scenes are the exclusive signature of this film, the bgm's are so perfect accordingly to the scene that intensifies the mood of the audience, truly this is the work of distinction.",requiemforadream
"A funny, at times, but, sad view of addiction. This film shows the loneliness and desperation being an addict can bring as well as moments of hope and wanting something more. I wish I could give it more stars because the movie and the cast deserve more than a simple 5 star rating.",requiemforadream
"Still one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. This hallucinogenic cautionary tale about drug addiction does not hold back. The decent into the hellish depths of addiction is brilliantly acted by all. The score is also really powerful and as the four protagonists become more depraved, tortured and in the end left like soulless zombies the music becomes almost hypnotic. Love it!",requiemforadream
"I'm not really a fan of the movie. It reminds me of Fear And Loathing without the humor, without the likable characters, and the movie doesn't mean anything. It's the cinematic equivalent of an anti-drug PSA and has all the subtlety of Reefer Madness. But as someone who appreciates the art of downer cinema I give the movie credit for having some of the most distressing scenes I've ever seen in a movie. It didn't effect me emotionally because I just didn't care about the characters. It tries to pull a Martin Scorsese by showing us bad people who get it in the end, but Jared Leto and Marlon Wayans are no Robert DeNiro and Ray Liotta. This might sound cruel, but the film kind of reminds me of an Itchy And Scratchy cartoon. Like I said, the exception are a few very pitiful scenes, but if you saw a real mouse chop up a real cat with a chainsaw you might find that a little more shocking. I think Aronofsky is overrated, but he's definitely a visionary. In the future I think he'll be more known for his impact on movies in general than the movies themselves.",requiemforadream
"I was surprised I did not add a review of this film earlier. Perhaps I forgot to. Where do I start? This film is just an outstanding masterpiece. It delivers its content in a magnificent way. Although it took me 30 minutes to really start understand (a bit of) what was going on the film, the film gets possible to be understood after that quite easily. Truly a work of art. The story is phenomenal, actors are great, originality is top-notch and the overall quality of the film outbursts in hyper-sized shines (ironic, because it's a very dark film). There is much more that I had to write on this review, but I only like to make reviews right after watching the film, because a bit is forgotten and/or cannot be well explained, or put into words. Regardless, now the most important part of the review,.... I give this film a worthy 5/5, because it really deserves it. Totally on my favorite films of all time.",requiemforadream
"This has to be one of the most disturbing yet beautiful movies I've ever seen. This is very much a cautionary tale, you will not watch this movie and feel happy and uplifted by the end.

"hense the title of the movie being the title of the song that is played throughout the movie, the song gets annoying, like the movie sometimes. the screenplay isnt that original, but i like it and it works. The cinemetography and scene editing is nice when it works, but its annoying, and unforgetable when it doesn't, but i understand why the filmmakers did some of these annoying things, and it really makes sence i just dont like it that much. most of the camera work is in the characters perspective and they are high most of the time, so its always kind of choppy, time-lapsed and fast motion blur, with weird sound effects and a boring score. the acting is pretty fuckin good, and thats what i really like about this movie, but almost every good thing in this movie was cancelled out by somthing bad, or somthing not good, or somthing that wasn't very entertaining. but as a whole i really dont think its that bad overall, i just think its a little over rated, and if it wasnt for the performances or casting and some of the disturbing imaginary scenes, and sometimes not imaginary scenes were very good, and some of the things written for the characters add alot of weight to the characters which made me want to watch more. this is not a thought provoking film which i wanted it to be, it is just plain, strait up weird and about drug addiction and what it is like to live in a world of coruption and drugs. the two best things about this movie, were the writing, and the strong performances from Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely,Marlon Wayans surprisingly and Jared Leto's mother in the film that got nominated for an Oscar, which was definatly worthy. So, if you're bored and maybe considering having a movie marathon or somthing, because its definatly a film worth viewing.

"Really inconsistent movie. It's good at parts, but terrible at other. It's like a crazy roller coaster that will make you sick and nothing really happens in the movie. It's about prescription drugs and illegal drugs. About the effects about both of those drugs. Nothing special. Most concepts in this movie don't hold water over time because people should already know this. Also some of the effects of prescription drugs were way worse than the illegal drugs. It's really strange and isn't really cohesive. The movie then drags on for three years and I actually started to get tired. Overall its not complete trash but just on the list of another shitty Darren Aronofsky movie. 1.2",requiemforadream

"An exceptionally well-crafted thriller that still haunts my dreams to this day. Ghosts and creepy little kids are not scary. This is FRIGHTENING. The Ellen Burstyn hallucinations are some of the creepiest sequences I have ever seen. However, this is still a great film and although it may not have a Hollywood ending (to say the least), it sends a clear message to be careful with drugs.",requiemforadream
"A powerful and disturbing story about addiction from Darren Aronofsky, Requiem for a Dream gives us the twin tales of a mother and sons fall into linked but very different drug-fuelled nightmares. There are moments of the darkest of humour as the lives of the pair spiral out of control but the fates of both are dealt with in an unflinching and graphic manner that is cold and disturbing. Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto lead the cast and for me, Burstyn's story is probably the most heart-breaking as we see the lonely old widow become dependent on tranquillisers and slimming pills as she becomes obsessed with the chance of appearing on a low-budget TV game show. This is a hard-hitting and deeply uncomfortable movie that seems as brutally relevant today as it was when it was first made over a decade ago. The score by the brilliant Clint Mansell underpins the onscreen imagery perfectly and has rightly gone on to have a life of its own, being instantly recognisable. Not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, this is a powerful drama from a superb filmmaker.",requiemforadream

"Wow, Requiem for a Dream is so dark and depressing. It is easily one of the most detailed looks into how drug abuse can destroy your life. Aronofsky uses every trick in the director's playbook to give the audience the sensation of being affected by the addictions of the main characters. There is shaky camera work, there are dramatic focus shifts. Even the music is used to create an unsettling atmosphere. It puts you on edge as a viewer, and makes it utterly impossible to relax while watching the movie. Perhaps the most amazing thing to me was that the actors actually managed to make their characters sympathetic to me. There were moments where I actually wanted them to have a successful sale in order to dig themselves out of the pit they had fallen into. Typically it's hard for me to identify with a movie character who continues to make the wrong decisions, but some magical combination of the script and the acting had me rooting for these people. One of the most effective techniques that Aronofsky used in this film are the repetitive smash-cut montages of each step that goes into taking drugs. It made for a really artistic way of showing how the drug abuse had become routine to the characters, and it also offered a great contrast when later Ellen Burstyn's character became addicted to her own drug of choice. I also enjoyed what this film had to say about people who struggle with a less toxic, but perhaps just as damaging, addiction like television. It makes you question your own life and look to see what you have grown overly attached to that might be getting in the way of more important things. The one thing about Requiem for a Dream that kind of holds me back from absolutely falling in love with it is that this film is exceedingly hard to watch. In fact I can't picture subjecting myself to it again, at least not for a really long time. While I do think it is amazingly well-constructed, and startlingly realistic, there's nothing that would prompt me to want to go through that again.",requiemforadream
"Highly recommended to young and elderly people, or everyone with potential exposure to drug abuse. The movie brilliantly described the outcome of drug addiction behavior. Portrayed lavishly in artistic manner, one may not notice the horrible hallucinogenic effect of drug prescription by any irresponsible medics. The theme song haunts ludicrously from beginning to end, however it colored the right atmosphere the picture needs. Grim, alarming, yet melancholic. Youth only come once, hence you may stumble once or few times but not to fall too deep nor steep for it may be too late to resuscitate later.",requiemforadream
"A truly unbelievable experience, ""Requiem for a Dream"" chronicles descent into drug addiction with a stomach churning, bleak ferocity that is totally unparalleled. Possibly the most important and effecting film about this subject matter ever made.",requiemforadream
"Blends the gritty reality of addiction with an overarching poeticism, brilliant direction, and idiosyncratic, inspired acting. Very intense and stark images are disturbing, beware. Much like a dream with elements of the dark, desperate fears, this is a cautionary tale of filmmaking despite the disturbing subject matter.",requiemforadream
"I always thank creating a movie about addiction will bring a stereotype, but this movie showed me that work of a great director may vary and be new, the effect of this movie on viewer is very high",requiemforadream
"***Due to the recent RT changes that have basically ruined my past reviews, I am mostly only giving a rating rather than a full review.***",requiemforadream
"""Marion... I've been thinking about you so much... are you okay?"" Requiem for a Dream is dark and perverted account of the downfall of four drug addicts. While basing his film around drugs, Aronofsky's use of imagery and detail will trigger a muscle in the viewers mind that explores all and any sort of - addiction. Requiem is about addiction, indecency, loss of love and innocence. It may appear as an anti-drug scheme to a basic minded individual but any open minded person will walk away challenged, I definitely was.",requiemforadream
Very jumbled up and at first glorified drugs. As it went along it was then aimed at the miseries of drug use and abuse. Very good in that aspect but overall a dull movie. Acting was pretty decent.,requiemforadream
"Darren Aronofsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"" is a masterful work of art that is a powerful display of the damages of drug addiction. The finale of this movie will stick with you long after the credits roll. The movie's real and effective story, brilliant direction, and strong performances. It is by no means a film you will want to watch again any time soon or one that is easy to take in, but is one that must be experienced by everyone. The way the film uses quick shots and the haunting score give it a unique power that is truly well done. It's a deeply saddenining motion picture that will leave you shaking.",requiemforadream
"it's hard to know where that line lies between desires and addiction; Aronofsky said this film isn't about drugs, it's about monsters -- everyone has potential to experience addiction to something (not necessarily drug related) and it's scary how fast you can fall under it's spell. the film did a great job of depicting just 4 examples of how addiction can change a person's life. even though none of the outcomes were good, the mother's story hit closer to home for me. i've never come close to wanting to do drugs, so hers was the most relatable. it's great to have goals and strive to be something better, but when that turns into obsession -- or rather, addiction -- you could be doing more harm than good.",requiemforadream
Can't even describe into words how much this movie means to me. Ellen Burstyn went above and beyond. Perfect film even if disturbing and heart wrenching in parts. I wish that Marlon Wayons would have walked out of that door that Aronofsky opened for him to be a serious actor... But he didn't. He chose to remain a Wayans and not be taken seriously. Oh well. He had the chance.,requiemforadream
Strong movie with a strong message. At the end it made me grateful I'm not addicted to anything. You gotta watch it in the right mood though cos it's depressing.,requiemforadream
This movie left me speechless. The way that it goes from scene to scene is insane. This movie never gets old from start to finish. One of the best movies out there.,requiemforadream
"A filmmaking masterpiece, the editing is phenomenal as well as the pace of the film. 2 men and a woman strive to make it in New York City selling heroin, but end up realizing they've embarked on the wrong path. Definitely leaves you speechless at the end. Great replay value, a timeless classic.",requiemforadream
"Uma das maiores performances do cinema vinda de Ellen Burstyn e uma das mais competentes direções do ano de seu lançamento, ""Réquiem para um Sonho"" é tão perturbador quanto seu título, e comove, deprime e enlouquece mais que qualquer pílula.",requiemforadream
"Good Visuals, but over all the film feels like a one hour PSA on not doing drugs..The Problem with this film is that there is no character to connect with, they are all egotistical or selfish morons, why should I care about a character who is an ass to his mom and dose drugs to death?",requiemforadream
"This film is about drugs and addiction. Not a love story, not a happy ending tale. It shows were a person could end up, when using. It;s brutal, but it;s true. it's a punch in the face, disturbing.",requiemforadream
A movie so horrifying that you can't look away if you tried. This movie will make you want to never do drugs and give you nightmares for quite a while. Also an awesome and fitting soundtrack.,requiemforadream
"Stylistic. Delirious. Confronting. Burstyn plays her tragic role perfectly. While Leto, Wayans and Connelly remind us how horribly wrong it could all go.... TL;DW - Drugs are bad.",requiemforadream
"Well-made, deeply unsettling and potent, the strength of this film lies in its editing and the actors' performances. While sometimes overbearing, and though I do still go to 'Trainspotting' when I need a hard reminder of the tolls that addiction takes, this film deserves some credit as well.",requiemforadream
Tragic film banking on quick cuts of flashy over-stimulation. I appreciate the effort and some of the artistic liberties taken but saw the characters' conclusions a bit forced and over-the-top.,requiemforadream
"While this is one of Aronofsky's better movies with some great cinematography and style,the first half of Requiem For a Dream should be as powerful, potent, and viscerally emotional as the second. However, few movies have been able to capture what drug addiction does to our bodies, to our minds, and to our lifestyle so well. If you want someone close to you to stop drug addiction, make them watch this movie; it's *that* shocking.",requiemforadream
"While most people see movies solely for entertainment value, several of us actually welcome a challenge. Requiem for a Dream is a graphic and often unpleasant movie, but it's evident that was the intention. Disney cartoons and comic-book blockbusters are all fine and good, but movies like this are the reason I'm a movie addict. Movies about young, strung-out junkies are not new. Movies like Another Day in Paradise, Rush, and Kids all addressed similar issues, to varying degrees of success. The tough part is not showing the ugliness of heroin addiction. Just watch someone shooting up and you're seeing a tragedy. What's difficult is presenting honest characters, and not apologizing for their actions. They're not heroes or villains in Aronofsky's hands, and how you feel about these characters lies with you. The screenplay doesn't guide you, and any movie that forces you to decide things for yourself is always a welcome change. Everyone has their addictions, right? For some, it's crack cocaine. Others can't function without their morning cup of coffee. Love, contentment, approval, happiness; Wish for any of them too hard, and you find yourself an addict. Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream displays how rampant addiction affects the lives of four interlocked characters, and it's not a pretty picture. But that's exactly why this is an excellent movie. While several scenes are of unnerving discomfort, the intention is never simply to shock. A filmmaker can ""stun"" an audience whenever he wants to; it's his party. The tough part is to tell a story and prove thematic points by using the shock value responsibly. Harry (Jared Leto) is a heroin addict. When we first meet him, he is appropriating his mother's television set to hock for his next ""fix"". Long-suffering mother Sarah (Ellen Burstyn) screams with her son, but never really gets angry with him. Five minutes later, she's simply buying the TV back. Harry's best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) also participate in Harry's hypodermic activities, and the three eventually hatch a plan: To become dealers on their own and make thousands of bucks! Meanwhile, Sarah has received a strange phone call, promising her a spot as a TV contestant. Alone in her home, she quickly begins preparing for her night on TV by popping diet pills. This is a movie of several excellent components, most notably a handful of excellent performances, a restrained yet visually stunning directorial style, and a hypnotic musical score. While a handful of scenes linger a bit too long, that's a nearly pointless complaint in a movie so strong on nearly every other level. Requiem for a Dream is not a ""fun"" movie, nor is it merely a drug-related melodrama. This is a smart movie about how addiction shackles people, for movie fans who can handle the heavy stuff. Ellen Burstyn is remarkable in this movie. While she hasn't been seen in films too often lately, her performance simply should place her back in this should have placed her in the public eye. As a woman who becomes increasingly more unable to deal with reality, she is heart-breakingly believable, and the result is one of the best acting performances I have seen. Also quite surprising is the work of Jennifer Connelly, in a nearly impossible role. Her stunning beauty has somehow mislabeled her as a ""pin-up"" actress, as she's nearly always excellent, regardless of how small the role. She'll get a lot of attention for her courageous performance. Jared Leto is serviceable as the anti-hero Harry. Although it's easy to buy him as a junkie, he simply plays his role too clean-cut most of the time. Leto is tough to buy him as a sleazy addict when he looks like the cover of a Teen magazine. Director Aronofsky presents several unique sequences, and he offers several harsh and resonant montage sequences, some truly shocking visual sequences, and a wonderfully effective usage of sound effects. (Each moment of addiction satisfaction is presented in a rapid-fire display of color, light and sound.) Especially memorable is the use of the infectious score by Clint Mansell, which gives the movie a dark, desperate heartbeat. Much has currently been made of the MPAA's decision to threaten this movie an NC-17 rating, thanks to a sequence near the end, which depicts some particularly unsavory acts. Apparently, The MPAA missed the point of this movie entirely. By deleting (or even editing) the scene in question would negate the entire point of the movie: That true addiction leads to true degradation. I was glad he didn't compromise. I can't promise that you'll love this movie, but you'll be able to see how censoring a movie can sometimes disembowel it. Requiem for a Dream is a tough movie to watch, but the film offers a lot to enjoy. Darren Aronofsky deftly avoids many of the ""drug-movie"" cliches so evident in other films of this style, and his film is a sobering and fascinating piece of work. While this movie is NOT for all tastes, I can recommend it as one of the best and bravest drug-movies ever made . Requiem for a Dream is a film that will stay with you long after you leave the theater, and it's a rare film that can do that.",requiemforadream
"Everything about this movie is fantastic. The score, the acting, the story, the writing, the directing, the visuals, literally everything. No movie has ever left me feeling so hopeless before, and to this day it is the only movie that has physically shaken me. Requiem For a Dream is a masterpiece in every sense of the word and it might very well be the best movie of the 2000s thus far. If you haven't seen it, I implore you to watch it. 11/10",requiemforadream
"An experience so you don't have to. Once you see it from start to finish, you'll understand. Overall, a masterpiece of visual storytelling and character empathy.",requiemforadream
This is an impossible movie to rate. Did I like it? No. Is it extremely well made? Absolutely. This beautifully directed and acted movie is truly stunning. The most powerful movie I've ever seen. Never before has a movie truly disturbed me to the point of sweating or cringing. Ellen gives a powerful performance especially near the end of the film. Requiem for a Dream has a very claustrophobic feeling to it and you will hardly be able to breath during the movie due to the intensity and atmosphere. Lux aterna is a great song and the soundtrack really adds to the movie as a whole. A movie that is impossible to forget and will leave you stunned for a long time after the credits role.,requiemforadream
"A visceral experience if nothing else. Fearless acting performances and stylistically daring choices by Darron Aranofsky gives 'Requiem' a fascinatingly hypnotic quality, but the film's insistently grotesque, bludgeoning imagery and overwrought chaos violently collapses in on itself as the thing devolves into a suspect mess.",requiemforadream
"The most bone chilliing movie I have ever seen. This movie gives us a very realistic portrayal of drugs and the dark corners of humans and how far they can go for it. This movie honestly scares with its realism. The performances are Top-Notch! And why didn't the theme song ""Requiem for a Tower"" win/get nominated for any Oscars? It is awesome and just like the movie, Bone chilling. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen...but I never want to see it again. Understand my logic?",requiemforadream
"WOW!! What a ""don't do drugs"" ad! Great acting and the cinematography is GREAT as well as the acting! Even a bigger Jared Leto fan now!",requiemforadream
"The people at D.A.R.E. must salivate over this movie. If you've ever found yourself wondering whether or not to try hard drugs, this film should put that flame out with a vengeance.",requiemforadream
"Brutally awfull, Aronofsky's Requiem shows us how we destroy our lifes by choosing to live our fantasies. Very strong and intended for a mature audience, this movie is a living nightmare that will pursuit forever. You will never forget Ellen Burstyn perfomance or Jared Leto's arm. One of the best",requiemforadream
*OFFICIAL BETTER THAN EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE SEAL* Emotionally manipulative waste of time that cares more about its anti drug message than its characters. Great music though.,requiemforadream
"The term ""nightmare film"" does not mean a film that is so terrible that it was a nightmare to make, rather it refers to a film that it the living embodiment of a nightmare that one would have. Requiem for a Dream plays out in a way that can only have been drawn from someone's deepest psychological terrors that come out to play in the time of twilight, in which the definite barrier between reality and hallucination is commonly deteriorated. This is probably one of Mr Mackey's favourite movies.",requiemforadream
Probably my favorite independent film and the best movie I've ever seen on drug addiction. With a fantastic visual style and brilliant score this movie will haunt you long after you've watched it.,requiemforadream
"The movie is as entretaining as it gets just as its harsh and imaginative, and its a cinematographical achievement, filled with shocking and heartbreaking moments supported by the stellar cast and almost perfect directing and writing. One hell of an amazing and shocking ride.",requiemforadream
Everything a movie should be. It shows the harsh reality of drug addiction through great performances and simple yet impactful cinematography. This movie won't leave you with a cheesy message or a cliche uplifting ending.,requiemforadream
"Notable como pocas, Réquiem for a Dream tiene un gran problema. No es agradable de ver. 4 historias vinculadas a la droga y la soledad se mezclan, desencadenado cada una en especie de locura. La obra que consolidó a Aronofsky como director de renombre, y en especial a Clint Mansell, por un soundtrack que quizás es el más conocido de la historia. Recomendable, pero afirme el estómago.",requiemforadream
"As it stands right now, Requiem for a Dream is not the most comfortable film to watch, but in terms of the acting, the execution, and the imagery, it is a masterpiece. Full review at filmbroadcaster.weebly.com",requiemforadream
"7.5/10 Requiem for a Dream is a true visual marvel, and does a brilliant job of creating nail-biting tension and a nightmarish scenario - however, it's a bit too heavy handed in its anti-drug message to truly soar.",requiemforadream
"Rude Yankees using perverse robot technology, to dig into a sunken ship. Finding a nude drawing. Then comes an old woman, who survived the shipwreck. And it's her. Personally I would have left everything down there, and I also prefer men. So, it would have been extremely more interesting to see a nude drawing of Dicaprio. There's also this unbelievable class gap, that of course let the working class people drown. While there's still a chance for the capital owners to survive. The scene with Dicaprio tied up, and the water's rising, I feel is a cheap, suspence thing. I find it also a bit strange that the couple couldn't hold on to the raft together. All in all, it's not inspiring to me.",titanic
I watch titanic at least once every year. It is a classic movie that is based on true events along with a whole love story with it. Absolute must see and makes me cry every time,titanic
"Rewatchable because of its greatnes when it comes to special effects, scenography and emotions. The fictive story is however quite silly with clumpsy references to real people such as Rose owning a picasso and the characters hanging out with all of the most prominent figures abord the ship.",titanic
"9.5/10 The film's occasionally clunky dialogue draws some questionable looks, but that's the biggest problem I got. With that out of the way, I say this movie was James Cameron at his peak. With his deep passion and huge ambitions, he crafted a work so timeless, grand, and spellbinding that it still stood nearly 30 years later as a giant in the world of blockbuster filmmaking. It may not be perfect, but it's still a work of great excellence. It's something I don't see Hollywood making ever again.",titanic
Unpopular opinion but I think this movie was excruciatingly boring to the point I couldn't finish it maybe its just cause I'm not the right audience,titanic
One of the greatest films by a legendary filmmaker. This fantastic picture never gets old and too many amazing humans who performed so well in this one are no longer with us. Love everything about this one!,titanic
"Loved seeing this again on the big screen and glorious Dolby Atmos mix. The pacing is a bit slow. It could be about 30 minutes shorter and the ending is a bit of downer. The tragedy within a tragedy is a bit overpowering. But Leo and Kate look terrific. The rest of the cast holds up well. Stunning visuals and special effects, especially the iceberg and ship break-up scene. None better, even after 27 years.",titanic
"I mean, what is there to say? Is this the most watched and most iconic movie of all time? Probably. The first half of the movie is an epic romance period piece, then the second half of the movie is a thrilling disaster movie, even though you knew the fate of the ship coming into the movie. It is epic and incredibly watchable for being three hours.",titanic
"“Titanic” is a memorable cinematic masterpiece, not only for its artistic value but also for being a landmark in the history of cinema and across generations. The film presents a solid and engaging screenplay that captivates viewers from beginning to end. It also features impeccable performances and visual effects of the highest quality, which greatly enhance its grandeur. Without a doubt, “Titanic” is an unmissable classic that has secured its place in the history of the seventh art.",titanic
"Mi película favorita, es toda una joya, una joya que a todos nos a echo llorar y nos dejó fascinados con la historia del RMS Titanic, el barco que en su día fue el más grande del mundo, creado por la white Star line lo mejor que e visto",titanic
My heart… it's so emotional. Rose and Jack truly loved each other 💔 I really appreciated their story in Titanic — such a wonderful & harmony.,titanic
It’s a perfect mid movie. I might have a small bias because I’ve seen this thing more times than I’ve had hot breakfast but when I watch it it just doesn’t hit the same. It’s predictable in a mediocre way and at some times feels like it’s running on for too long. Jack is a very well written character along with Thomas Andrew’s who really bring light to this movie. Rose has a really well character arc but this movie just falls short and you can tell that while it was good it could have been better.,titanic
This is one of the best movies I have seen in a while I don’t like romance movies but this movie has changed my mind I would 10/10 recommend this and rewatch this,titanic
I'm happy to meet this film. This film is a bible for me! This love story is tragic but has a permanent brilliance and beauty.,titanic
My favorite movie of all time. Such a great storyline and cast was phenomenal. 28 years later and it has held well even against current releases. What's not to love!,titanic
"A timeless classic and a guilty pleasure of many men. Titanic boasts beautiful set pieces, a nice story and a great cast. It’s ok to be a man and admit you love this film!",titanic
"Para sempre o maior filme de todos os tempos. James Cameron fez de Titanic um marco histórico para o cinema e um símbolo de competência e grandiosidade. Leonardo DiCaprio dilacera corações com seus olhos azuis e Kate Winslet está arrebatadora e estonteante. Tudo aqui é perfeito, do roteiro à atuações. É impossível controlar o choro. Nada se compara a Titanic, seja a mitologia ou a produção primorosa do filme.",titanic
This is a Romeo and Juliet story but done well and unique. The last hour of the film once the bout starts to sink is very good,titanic

2 stories put into one movie. Certainly gained more attention at the time than it deserved. Holds up well and worth a watch. Far cry from a classic.,titanic
"One of the most iconic films of all time, Titanic blends an unforgettable love story with a historical tragedy. Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) share an impossible romance aboard the luxurious ocean liner, whose sinking marks the film’s heartbreaking climax. The music, visual effects, and raw emotion turned it into a global phenomenon. MARIANA ALFONSO SOLANO 1002",titanic
This movie was trash.. I thought that the movie was real.... shot was fake the love story was fake... made me shade a tear for no reason,titanic
"This is my absolute favourite movie! I cry EVERY TIME! I love the actors, especially Leo and Kate <3 This is such an addictive movie, it’s filled with emotion and facts. I love it dearly and it melts my heart every time. Once I was rewatching it and during Jack’s death I had to PAUSE THE MOVIE to compose my self !",titanic
"I'm a Titanic buff. Read lots of material, watched countless documentaries about the tragedy. I'm a movie buff as well - and it gets me every time i watch this unforgettable piece of work. This is a storytelling it's at is best. Visuals are outstanding even at this time, after 16 years - Titanic is aging wonderfully. The actor, all of them, did a very strong job, and i loved the two leads. I can not understand why is there so much negative buzz about this film. They say it's to chezee. You can throw a rock in me if you haven't saw more chezee stuff years after (Twilight and all the dancing shxx ""movies"" comes in to a mind first). Well i guess lots of people will always hate what is popular and at the same time really good - and that's a rare combination. Movies like this aren't made every day to say the least, and it's shame that so many people trashes them. Well, you can always just ignore them. Titanic is outstanding motion picture in every possible way, and it got what it deserved - 11 Oscars, 1,6 milliard at the box office and hardly nforgettable journey - it's hardly gets better than this.",titanic

"The grand scale and decadence of the Titantic rubs on off the film, giving it a sense of grandeur. It elevates it from a romance to an event film, a historical movie in both senses of the word. The sinking of the Titantic is impressive, but the ship is even more impressive when seen whole throughout the movie. Cameron makes sure to let us see into lots of nooks and crannies, letting us feel as if we're getting to know the ship as well as the characters. DiCaprio steals the show over Winslet, but mostly because he was given a more likeable character to work with.",titanic
"I had the pleasure of seeing Titanic in the movie theater back in 2023 for the 25th anniversary rerelease. I was 17 and my mom really wanted to me to go. I had always wanted to see a classic movie in the theater so of course I wanted to go. It really is one of the best movies ever. If you don’t like this movie then I don’t like you. Hahaha. My friend says she doesn’t like this movie. Of course I like my friend, but aside from that. Like I said it is one of the best movies ever made. Letter grade: A",titanic
"Pound for pound, best movie ever made. How can you beat this story, score, acting and overall masterful performance than a young Leo while being directed by the great James Cameron? This is the greatest movie of all time with the best closing scene ever. It’s been nearly 30 years and no one has topped it.",titanic
This movie was awesome. I’ve been wanting to watch titanic for years and finally have. Is such a cute love story between Jack and Rose. I loved seeing how they kept fighting for each other shows how strong their relationship was. If you love romance then this movie is for you. Spoil alert you definitely will cry at the end.,titanic
"Personally I just skipped over the romance part and went to the part where it starts to sink. This movie perfects the Titanic sinking and the sadness of it as well. No other movie can perfect this one, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time while it was sinking, this movie may make some people cry from how deep and somber it is.",titanic
"I really liked this movie! The plot is very exciting. In some moments it was positive and funny, and in others it was sad and sorrowful. Also, after watching the movie I got a lot of useful information, one of which is that the Titanic was the largest liner at that time! This fact is very amazing. I recommend watching it.",titanic
"BEST MOVIE EVER! If you like history and/or romance, this movie is for you. This film displays the sinking of the Titanic in an exceptional way while still keeping the realism. Even the way that they displayed the frozen bodies at the end of the movie blows my mind. 5/5 must see!",titanic
"Epic romance and tragedy done right. The scale is massive, the emotional payoff is huge, and the whole thing looks beautiful. You already know how it ends, but it still hits.",titanic
"Um dos meus comfort movies preferidos. É melodramático? Sim. Usa o cenário de uma tragédia real para contar um romance fictício, clichê e previsível? Usa. Mas eu revi, aos 30 anos de idade, com o mesmo deslumbre e fascínio que eu tinha aos 10? Oh, yeah! E eu não vou nem vou me aprofundar no espetáculo visual. Eu já falei e não canso de repetir que James Cameron faz filmes que, simplesmente, não envelhecem. ""Titanic"" é visualmente esplêndido, movido por uma épica história de amor. E quem não gosta desse filme, sinto dizer, já morreu por dentro.",titanic

"Titanic, the 1997 cinematic masterpiece, features the remarkable Leonardo DiCaprio alongside the talented Kate Winslet, who would later become a legendary figure in her own right. Under the exceptional direction of James Cameron, this film was crafted with immense passion and dedication. He poured his heart and soul into creating a captivating world that would resonate with audiences for generations to come. Leonardo DiCaprio delivered an outstanding performance as Jack, investing every ounce of his talent into the role. His portrayal was nothing short of extraordinary, especially for a young actor at the time, and it propelled him into stardom, marking a significant turning point in his career. Kate Winslet was equally compelling as Rose, and her role in Titanic set her on the path to becoming a megastar. She left an indelible mark on film history with the iconic line, ""Paint me like one of your French girls,"" ensuring that her performance would be remembered long after the credits rolled. Overall, Titanic is an incredible film that captivates from start to finish. It offers a rich tapestry of emotions and experiences, with the exception of horror—unless you consider the tragic sinking of the ship and its consequences as a form of horror. Beyond that, it transcends mere entertainment, providing a profound cinematic experience that celebrates love and life. I wholeheartedly encourage everyone to watch it!",titanic
"Though it’s a simple film with a large dose of corniness, it does one thing very very well. The love story at its centre is one of the greatest of all time. DiCaprio (Jack) and Winslet (Rose) are utterly believable together and have great chemistry. Their portrayal of true love found and then lost is heartbreaking, and a devastating sense of loss sits with me long after the end credits roll. Winslet’s transformation from repressed fiancé to passionate free spirit is beautifully done and DiCaprio is wonderful as the catalyst for her freedom. I cry every time I watch this.",titanic
"Tharathip Namtasaeng 67070507816=> James Cameron’s Titanic is an epic romance and disaster film that masterfully blends historical events with a deeply emotional love story. Set against the backdrop of the RMS Titanic, the movie follows Jack Dawson, a free-spirited artist, and Rose DeWitt Bukater, a young aristocrat trapped in a life of privilege she resents. Their passionate love story unfolds as the cruise of the era, the Titanic ultimately collides with the tragic reality of its sinking. I am in love with the cinematography of this movie. It is breathtaking, capturing the Titanic with remarkable detail. From the lavish first-class dining halls to the engine rooms where the workers toil, every scene is incredibly crafted to transport viewers back to 1912. Everything looks so realistic and in time. The special effects, particularly the scenes of sinking sequence, remain impressive even watching this movie decades later, creating an intense emotion that immerses the audience in the disaster’s chaos. The main actor and actress of this movie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver phenomenal performances, bringing depth and authenticity to their roles. Jack played by DiCaprio is charming, adventurous, and full of life, while Rose played by Winslet is elegantly rebellious, struggling against societal constraints. Their chemistry making the romance and romantic scenes on point. Billy Zane, as Rose’s ruthless fiancé Cal, adds tension with his villainous portrayal, heightening the stakes of the story which I really like. The iconic score of My Heart Will Go On enhances the film’s emotional impact. The music beautifully underscores the highs of Jack and Rose’s romance and the devastation of the ship’s sinking, leaving a lasting impression on viewers. The screenplay strikes a balance between heartfelt moments, thrilling action sequences, and historical authenticity, ensuring that the narrative remains engaging throughout the three-hour runtime of the movie. Beyond its love story, Titanic explores themes of class disparity, fate, and survival. The stark contrast between the privileged first-class passengers and the struggling third-class travelers highlights the extreme social hierarchies of the time. The film’s emotional weight making it more than just a romance. Watching this film is a tragic but unforgettable experience. With its stunning visuals, compelling performances, and emotional depth, Titanic is a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences. I love Titanic. This movie is an essential watch.",titanic
"I can’t be objective here. I saw Titanic in 1997, at just 8 years old, in a new cinema in Buenos Aires. At the time, I didn’t fully get the hype, but now, nearly 30 years later, it remains one of my favorites. The story between Rose and Jack has unforgettable moments: Rose’s hand on the fogged window, the villain taking the girl to the lifeboat, and the heartbreaking scene where Rose leaves Jack to freeze. Old Rose’s iconic “It’s been 84 years” line and the dramatic diamond drop are now part of pop culture. Despite its flaws, Titanic still resonates, with emotional highs and a love story that never gets old.",titanic
"I've not viewed this since the early 2000's. At the time I was taken with some of the effects, the great pacing, camera work and editing. And there are some sweet performances and great mis en scene but it's all inadequate to compensate for the maudlin bull during the majority of the film. The pre-collision exterior shots are silly, often amateurish, from the long shot of the vessel gliding along the sea to the burg that looks like a badly made stage piece - a cloud that fell to sea, this time I looked forward to the sinking so this party could be over. But, the last few scenes as the monster begins its dive to the North Atlantic ocean floor is a fun ride.",titanic
"An amazing brand spectacle that holds up a lot better than I remembered and definitely lives up to the hype as one of the most profitable and award-winning movies of all time. I liked the cool opening in the present day exploring the underwater wreckage work the submarine and framing of the story with old Rose. The cinematography is amazing and makes the Titanic feel larger than life, both warm & heavenly in the first half of the film, and then terrifying and hellish in the second half. The movie has a cool showcase of how the titanic works and how it sank with grand scale. The evil fiancé is entertaining, but admittedly corny. As a Midwesterner, I liked the mice shoutout to Jack talking about being from Wisconsin and its cold winters. The feminism subtext is mostly good, but a little patronizing and old fashioned at times in its 90's execution. There's interesting political reasons for why the Titanic sank because of wanting a shortcut to make headlines for it's speed as well as less life boats for clutter eyesore irony. I actually really liked the cute relationship where Jack saves Rose and she loves his paintings and freedom. The Kathy Bates character is funny and pretty cool. I also liked the cute Irish dancing scene. The movie is a sweet rom-com that turn into an epic and tragic disaster movie. I loved the sweet and intimate painting scene and steamy car scene. I also loved the cool water flooding practical effects. They’rez very exciting and tense with mass panic and grand spectacle. The movie does get a little receptive with the 2nd time Jack & Rose navigate the same flooded hallways after the ex-fiancé goes crazy with a gun with some insane mixed priorities. And there's a morally questionable decision where rose dumps the priceless jewel into the ocean, but still emotionally resonant with her final goodbye to Jack in finding closure. ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dione is iconic, but corny and all I can think of are the memes. But the movie still ends on a very sweet note with some nice subtle photo montage of Rose getting to fulfill her dreams after the Titanic and her heavenly symbolic return to Jack in the final after party of the Afterlife. The movie is titanic in its scale (pun entirely intended) and strikes the perfect balance between sweet & endearing with its character building, as well as the tense and exciting stakes of their survival at the hands of the titular sinking of the vessel that brought them together and changed their lives forever.",titanic
"We just re-watched this movie. Silvia and I watched it while dating in the theater. The special effects still are pretty cool to today standards. It’s supposed to be a romantic movie but it’s pretty intense. Fun fact. Titanic is the 4th top grossing movie. By my favorite writer / director James Cameron which BTW is vegan 🌱. 1 and 3 are avatar 1 and 2 which are also James. Very entertaining. My only thing that I would change is. Jack would’ve fit in the door and , what a waste to throw away the stone 😹 🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿/5 on Hulu",titanic
This movie has an interestingly written screenplay. The film is a blockbuster and is a part of a canon of cinematography. It has many tense scenes and an interesting plot twist. The protagonists who feature in this film are cast by famous actors. The plot narrows down to two characters and their relationship. The tension is high through the whole movie especially after the catastrophe when the ship hits an iceberg. A famous scene shows the drama as the orchestra plays to the Titanic slowly sinking. This film is prime example of a romantic drama. I can recommend this movie with pleasure to anyone who has a free three hours.,titanic
Probably the greatest movie ever made. It has a little bit of everything. I still know people that have never seen it and that just blows my mind.,titanic
"One of my favorite films for the effects alone! That, and the fact that my aunt and cousins cried while watching this in the theater, told me this movie was special. They never, EVER cry in front of ANYONE for ANY reason. Epic.",titanic
It was really good I liked the story line the movie was really good like a Sid not much humor but still I liked it a lot,titanic
"Unas de las películas más inconicas de la historia del cine y de la cultura pop en general, una obra tan bien actuada que es imposible no encariñarse con Jack, con un drama tan impactante que uno cree que la historia en la película pudo ser real, es que la película cumple todo los requisitos de una película, buenas actuaciones, un musica hermosa, escenas inconicas para el cine, si que verdad que está película tiene errores de guión como el de la puerta aún si es una película que marcó el cine y para mí, la mejor película de romance de la historia, muy larga innecesariamente, si pero es una película que te metes en la trama que a veces se pasa volando ya para el último acto, sin duda la obra maestra de Cameron y DiCaprio.",titanic
"What sociopath had enough pull to push this deliriously wrong opinion to be the rotten tomatoes description paragraph for this flawless movie? I mean, come on",titanic
"Titanic (1997), directed by James Cameron, is one of those films that never loses its impact, no matter how many times you watch it. Some might call it overrated, but it's hard to deny the emotional weight and the sheer craftsmanship that went into making it. Rewatching it reminded me why it's stood the test of time, it's a great mix of story, performances, and technical execution. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver standout performances as Jack and Rose. Their chemistry is natural and believable, and it's what drives the story forward. The drawing scene is iconic for many reasons, both on and off the screen. Interestingly, it wasn't DiCaprio sketching Rose, it was actually James Cameron himself. Cameron, who's also an artist, added a personal touch to the scene by creating the famous drawing. Behind the scenes, Winslet knew the scene could be awkward since it involved nudity and was one of their first together, so she flashed DiCaprio to help him relax. Even with that, he was nervous and flubbed his line, saying, ""Lie on that bed... uh, couch"" instead of just ""couch."" The mistake stayed in the film, and it adds a little authenticity to the moment. Visually, Titanic is impressive on every level. The production design is meticulous. From the luxurious first-class interiors to the gritty third-class quarters, every set looks authentic and lived-in. The cinematography captures both the intimacy of Jack and Rose's relationship and the overwhelming scale of the disaster. The sinking sequence is still one of the most intense and well-executed moments in film. Cameron used a mix of practical effects, real sets, and CGI to recreate the chaos, and it all blends seamlessly. The result is a scene that's visually stunning and emotionally gripping. The final act ties everything together perfectly. Rose's memories, paired with James Horner's haunting score, deliver an emotional gut punch. That last shot is unforgettable and leaves you thinking long after the credits roll. Titanic isn't just about a historical tragedy or a love story, it's a film about human connection and the choices we make when everything's on the line. Cameron's attention to detail, paired with strong performances and excellent storytelling, makes this one of the most impactful films ever made. Overrated? Maybe. But it's a benchmark in filmmaking for a reason.",titanic
"Is a very beautiful movie because the story of love amoing Rose and Jack is really increible, since of when they meet until the death of Jack all for the difference of social classes . Since the first moment had my attention. I recomend watch this movie with many napkins to the side because until the most angry had that cry.",titanic
"The movie “titanic” is a dazzling movie that blows the audience away, directed by James Cameron in 1997, this movie won 11 Oscars! Including best picture and best director. Once this movie was released, it reached the top immediately and captured the hearts of the viewers. It gave people an emotional connection to the disaster. At the time, this movie was by far the most expensive movie! It introduces people to a world where a famous ship still existed. ACTORS Starring “Leonardo DiCaprio” as Jack Dawson and “Kate Winslet” as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Leonardo got 2.5 million, the best male performance, a best actor nomination and a glorious image! Kate Winslet got 2 million, however, she did not win any awards. Fortunately, this is their most successful movie that led them to success! RECOMMENDATION While titanic is a historical masterpiece, it also comes on a deep personal level, capturing the themes of love, loss, and survival. Whether you're drawn to history, romance, or drama, titanic is a film that sticks for life, mixing tragedy with beauty. Titanic is a cinematic experience that should not be forgotten.",titanic
"One of the best movies ever made!! It's sad it happened in real life (Titanic, not Jack and Rose). Rose should have moved over though",titanic
This is the definition of an timeless and future-proof. There are some genuinely tearing scenes and the effects are still mind blowing to this day.,titanic
"Despite being 12 when I watched this, I still thought it was a great movie, and the trippy part is that it felt kinda short",titanic
"James Cameron crafted an intricate historical film that hardly anyone takes the time to dissect. I am a Titanic historian and even after dozens of watch-throughs, I am still learning about Easter eggs and background characters that were actual Titanic passengers. Even if you aren't interested in the romance, take the time to learn about the true stories that Cameron honored -- except for Murdoch.",titanic
"First RT review - watched this again last night after seeing it at the movies 27 years ago and after seeing the Titanic - Th Human Story Exhibition- Magnificent - so moving. About to look it up, but I hope Kate got the Oscar for the water / blowing whistle scene alone. Have had a couple of Pina Coladas right now so hope I’m not over-reacting! It’s bloody good though",titanic
"O primeiro amor do cinema a gente jamais esquece. Foi assim que a primeira vista me encantei pela perfeição desse filme e que com certeza é minha obra prima favorita. Eu torcia pelo casal como se fosse real, mesmo sabendo o que acontece no final (o naufrágio do navio). Resultado de um roteiro que me prendeu do início ao fim e me levou a experimentar fortes emoções, graças a pura genialidade de James Cameron que produziu o mais absoluto espetáculo do cinema moderno.",titanic
I find it to be a brilliant film. I always cry at the end. Rose’s costumes and fashion is beautiful and I love the music.,titanic
"What is the most overrated movie of all time in my opinion? To me Titanic is not only the most overrated film in history, but also the weakest best picture winner in film history. Yes, I would watch other misses like The Broadway Melody and Around the World in 80 Days over this, although technically this is leagues better. Aside from the special effects, the story is hollow, the characters are bland, and we are stuck with this for over three hours. Plus, this caused movies like Boogie Nights and L.A Confidential to get robbed at the Oscars. I do like James Cameron as a director, especially his earlier films, but this is where he went downhill for me. While technically is good movie, I can't recommend this movie, but I am sure that most people will enjoy this film. The box office doesn't lie, maybe it's just me.",titanic
"History, Love, Loss, Suspense. This movie has it all. It has stood the test of time as one of, if not , the most memorable movie of all time.",titanic
"I absolutely LOVED this movie!!! It is one of my all-time favorite movies ever! A must see! Leonardo DiCaprio should have won an Oscar for best actor. The movie itself won 11 Oscars! I already liked movies about the Titanic, but this was the best one by far. When I first watched this movie in 1997 I loved it and 27 years later I still love it! I've watched it repeatedly over the years and it never gets old. It's a beautiful love story that left me in tears. The whole story was incredible and very dramatic. James Cameron is a great director. He told the story of the Titanic itself in a beautiful fashion, so well done.",titanic
"I see why it has become a classic: romance, drama and action - the movie has it all. I did not at all enjoy the scenes playing in the present though. The connection between past and present seemed rather forced and the scenes lacked the authenticity and magic of the main plot line.",titanic
"The more I see it, the more I like it. Most of the movies that are made these days are fantasy and extra science fiction. James Cameron has given us a good movie.",titanic
"As someone who enjoys the history of the Titanic, I found this film to be great from start to finish. This film does a great job at showing the history and honoring the ones lost while still being able to have a great love story between Jack and Rose. This movie has a long run time of a little over three hours but it never seems to drags on. Overall, this film is a classic and a must watch.",titanic
"If I had to summarize this movie in one word, it would be jaw-dropping. This movie is great for all ages and is a spectacular movie. However, some scenes may be inappropriate for some people.",titanic
A must-see film that was groundbreaking in 1997 and still holds up years later. The soundtrack is perfectly haunting and beautiful just like the story of romance upon that ill fated ship. Titanic continues to mystify and captivate us all with its tragic fate and this move does so well at capturing and playing on those emotions we all feel. Cameron is a genius director whose perfection of his subject and craft cannot be denied. Not sure why it’s now considered “cool” in some circles to deny this movie is spectacular. You naysayers know you saw it at least 2 times in the theaters. Stop playing.,titanic
One of the most amazing and emotional movies I have ever seen . If I ever meet anyone who hasn't see Titanic I'd think he is crazy!,titanic
Titanic was an okay movie it can be boring at times the film seems dated and did not age well to me Bill Paxton was the best part of the movie,titanic
"The NUMBER ONE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. Peacetime Maritime Tragedies are much painful than other disasters man made or natural. The love story of Rose and Jack is powerful, the fact that love conquers all.",titanic
"This is the only 3 hour movie that has managed to hold my interest the entire time. Powerful, thrilling, and tragic. It's a classic for a reason.",titanic
"This is one of those RARE films that truly deserve a 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating. Why is at 88%??? I almost never give a film a perfect rating, but Titanic has earned it over and over again.",titanic
Amazing movie. Great cast of characters and acting. The love story is fleshed out well and is believable. Leo and Kate did a fantastic job. And James Cameron did well with the special effects on the demise of the ship.,titanic
"I watched it in the theaters when it first came out. Watched it many times at home. I can go without seeing it again, The performances are great and the score and visuals are great. It just gets to be ling and boring to repeat. There's nothing new to see in multiple viewings.",titanic
"One of the greatest movies of all time for sure what more to ask? A love story on a sinking ship with numerous people drowning and screaming for their lives. To go along with Celine Dion soothing high range voice in the background. The only complaint I have is Rose I feel like they should've cast someone like Emma Watson skinnier and prettier, but at least Kate Winslet acting was on point. I just feel like she should've dropped a few more pounds for this role. But nevertheless it's not enough to give a movie like this less than five stars.",titanic
Still one of the most beautiful and emotional movies around. There is a level of horror in the soul at what those people went through.,titanic
"One of my all time favorite movies. Awesome way of showing how such a disaster really is. True masterpiece. The way you can get a mix of emotions no matter how many times you watch it. You still get that feeling of watching the first time. It doesn't matter if you already know what happens, the way it is shown is just heart wrenching and incredibly realistic. This movie made in 1997 is better than so many recent movies.",titanic
best spoof comedy of all time that james carmon really knows how to make a goofy kneeslapper had me loling in the theater and lmao in the theaters to makes me happy in all the places ;D,titanic
Deze film gaat over liefde op een boot leren ze elkaar kennen . Maar looptdie liefde welgoed af ?Geef deze filmzeker 5 sterren. Trouwens ik ben van Belgie! BELGIUM BEGIUMBELGIUM,titanic
"In my opinion it's a shame to see a pillar, or just a masterpiece with such bad ratings.. I've seen this movie 100 times and gives me still so much emotional moments. Despite it's not perfect, this is a top movie in the entire cinema history",titanic
"Titanic, one of my favorite movie. Fantastic combination of Epic Romance, Historical Context, Stunning Visuals, Emotional Depth, Memorable Music, Universal Themes, Strong Performances Cultural Phenomenon....",titanic
"Sorry for such a twist, but it seems that I felt that I don't like the movie Titanic anymore because of its overrated status and the sad story that makes me cry every time. I liked Kate Winslet better as Ronal in Avatar 2 (2022) rather like Rose in Titanic.",titanic
"One of the best romance movies of all times, it gets into the character, the plot, and story, and never gets boring from start to finish. If you have not watched this classic yet, then you should do it. I really recommend it and hope you enjoyed.",titanic
"This movie is very good and has an amazing character setup and storytelling quality. The amount of emotion put into this movie was incredible and the retelling of the classic, tragic story was very good. The creative addition with Jack and Rose was really a nice add-on. It had a great emotional storyline and the quality was good.",titanic
"While it isn't a perfect movie, I believe it was a well made and well done. Was the lines between the two lovers extremely thoughtful? No. Did this movie show the true perspective of everybody on the ship the night it sank? Not exactly. However it was a romance film with a lot of historical accuracy, and not meant to be a documentary and for it's genre I think it was a nicely made film that is still known to this day which is hard to say about other films.",titanic
"Easily one of the most well known movies of all time, for making one billion at the global box office, I was quite surprised to learn that it was 3 hours and 15 minutes, I mean, that's longer than it took the actual ship to sink! But, oh my God, James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, and Gloria Stuart make this one of the best romantic and terrifying movies of all time. The underlying suspense combined with the sexual tension makes for a true filmmaking classic.",titanic
"This was a huge achievement in film making. You could tell throughout that this was pure acting from all characters. Probably one of if not the best Leonardo Di'caprio Movies that he's been in. James Cameron paid attention to as much realism (beside the love story) as possible. Of course everyone says that things such as Jack being able to fit on the door ""Ruined"" this movie, but that would quite frankly be boring. Watch this on Apple TV right now if you haven't already. You won't regret it.",titanic
"Undeniably dramatic ending, but underwhelming cast appearance. Perhaps too non intellectual for this, but it was too long with edgy moments throughout to help you not leave the theater",titanic
"I think The Words ""CLASSIC"",""EPIC DRAMA"",""CULT Love Story"" are Started From This Movie... ABSOLUTE CINEMA moment for me... Rewatched so many times , Actors were Out Of The BOX in giving Epic Performances🧎",titanic
"Muy obra maestra, lo reconozco. Pero hay partes que no tocan sensibilidad, lloré más con los músicos que con el final entre Rose y Jack.",titanic
"Esse filme é uma obra de arte e com certeza entra no meu top 10 de melhores filmes, um filme que se passa tão rápido apesar de ter 3 horas de duração, recomendo pra todo mundo, um filme imperdível!",titanic
"Unpopular to say now but I believe that the movie was deserving of the awards and acclaim. Near perfectly executed popular entertainment. Thrilling, romantic, often very silly, and ultimately quite emotionally satisfying.",titanic
"Being set during the tragic sinking of the titular ship in 1912, Titanic follows the story of star crossed lovers amidst the historic calamity. Setting out to accurately capture the incident, director James Cameron poured years of research into depicting the event as closely as it played out on that fateful day. Successfully diving to the wreckage of the ship on multiple occasions, Cameron immersed himself with the task of documenting some of the smallest aspects and stories aboard the vessel. While many of the films characters are based on real attendants of the initial voyage, the leads Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) & Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) portray a completely original romantic tale throughout the event. Although the star crossed lovers are no new concept, the performance of the leads, accompanied by Cameron's writing, create one of the most timeless love story ever put to film. Each character beautifully adds to the story and each actor brilliantly embodies the time period and their individual roles in the wider tale. As a spectacle of visual effects, even over 25 years after its release, The Titanic was masterfully constructed to showcase every aspect of the absolutely horrific incident. With nearly every scene being filled with wondrous attraction, the climax resonates as the toll is taken on the emotional journey endured by viewers. Additionally, the companion piece of Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' fits flawlessly into the film and both elevate each others passionate message. James Cameron created a once in a lifetime experience with Titanic and, while capturing the realism of the event, created one of the greatest romances of this era.",titanic
"""Titanic"" reminds me of the power of film and cinema, particularly when combined with historical reference and authenticity. Cameron does a remarkable job of paying respect to the 1500+ individuals who undeservingly passed away due to what still feels like one of mankind's more recent greatest tragedies and parables. Although the love story may deter some, if one can allow it to sink in (pun not originally intended), it's a poetic piece of fabric woven within the realm of possibilities within a historical event and its many historical accuracies that Cameron goes above and beyond to maintain. The cast, class issues, and sets are all historic. The movie does not shy away from the horror of the incident and puts you right in the mix of a sinking ship as well as in the eyes of a survivor forced to witness the awe and dread of it all. At one point, Rose is staring up at a calm starry sky while hundreds of people around her are in a panicked frenzy to stay alive — something about that dichotomy really struck me as brilliant movie-making within this body of work. I'll never forget the sold out theatres and girls crying out loud throughout the movie, I haven't seen anything quite like it since. With 40 around the corner, the film hits differently. I don't shy away to consider it a masterpiece.",titanic
"The Titanic, a cinematic spectacle, sails on the edge of brilliance and cliché. James Cameron's 1997 epic weaves a love story into the tragic historical event. The film's grandeur is undeniable, with stunning visuals and a memorable score. However, the romance between Jack and Rose sometimes falls into predictable tropes. The historical accuracy is commendable, but the fictional elements tend to overshadow it. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet deliver compelling performances, elevating the material. While the film's impact is undeniable, its length and occasional melodrama may deter some viewers. Titanic remains a captivating, if flawed, voyage through history and romance.",titanic
"A work that was a cinematic triumph that marked generations, so beautiful and well developed, reporting an engaging romance that stood above social classes, incredible performances and a great real tragedy.",titanic
"I've no idea how this sits at a 69% rating. If you have an interest in making movies, watch this: you won't be disappointed. If you have a heart, watch this: you won't be disappointed. The set design, lighting design, acting, story and soundtrack are even today pretty much unmatched. It won all those awards for a reason. Ignore the haters and get it watched.",titanic
"After 25 years this is one of director James Cameron’s biggest crowning achievements and still one of the biggest blockbusters ever It's really heartbreaking knowing the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 actually happened in real-life and over 1500 passengers died from drowning next to subfreezing temperatures At the time it was James Cameron's most successful film earning over $2 billion on a $200 million budget and earning 11 Oscars He had the daunting task of working by himself a lot on production with the sets, the miniatures, even the camerawork and effects But he humanized this dramatic telling of one of the most tragic disasters in human history This was my first introduction to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet; they play Jack Dawson and Rose and boasted by a large cast of supporting players Bernard Hill, Francis McCoy, Billy Zane, the late Bill Paxton, the late David Warner, Victor Garber, and Kathy Bates Jack, a poor boy who happened to board the ship to start anew and Rose was born into a prestigious rich lifestyle but feels chained by it having no direction in her life When they both meet they unexpectedly form a romantic attachment seeing how their backgrounds differ so much Jack and Rose learn it isn’t about the money or being on the social ladder Yet Rose is engaged to be married to another man who’s slimy and will do anything to keep Jack from having Rose to himself, even her mother disapproves of Jack’s poor lack of income She becomes a much better character not letting the fire that burns within go out and that’s what Jack loves about her Everything drastically changes after the vessel hits an iceberg causing a tear in the hull and slowly hour by hour it starts to sink putting our leads and other passengers in mortal danger The clock is ticking as Jack and Rose try to make it out alive with everyone else regardless if they were rich or poor The movie made these young stars household names giving birth to endless memes, pop cultural references, and ongoing arguments of their survival This is also the film that gave birth to the hate culture; many people would call it a chick flick and not see past the bigger picture The film does an amazing job though looking at class, wealth, romance, the social ladder, and bravery trying to defy death all at a staggering 3 hours but moves by with ease Celine Dion's song My Heart Will Go On is still one of her most popular hits and she dedicated a lot of the lyrics to her late father James Horner’s music is so sweeping with the right amount of emotion and intensity The movie is filled with stories and themes that stretch from romance to expose, from parables of hubris to celebrations of industry The films social awareness of the disparity between upper and lower class is symbolic of the capitalist, western society in which we live despite predictability and flimsiness It’s important for us to live life liberated by shackles of aristocracy and feeling less constrained But in the end you really do feel for these characters and the natural disaster they find themselves in being very gripping and intense Give Billy Zane credit; even though he came off as an over the top bad guy they still made him almost appear like a genuinely nice person Cameron overlays a grand journey of the human spirit atop all the thrills, spills and clinches And the effects for the sinking of the ship itself still hold up immensely well with physical stunts, CGI, and actual sets built Overall it's a terrific, emotional film part love story, part disaster flick that still highlights the systemic issue that money is power but true love really conquers all",titanic
Cameron succeeded in making this film a masterpiece. It doesn't seem like it when you look at it but it was filmed in 97 impressively. This film allows us to remember all those who died during this tragedy,titanic
I love this movie. It is a masterpiece. I love how they brought Titanic and Passengers back to live. I love the soundtrack. Its amazing. The romance is fine.,titanic
"The best sense of pacing and suspense ever depicted on a movie screen. Titanic quickly turns from a heartfilled, character-driven delight to a gripping, heart-racing epic. A timeless masterpiece that will go on far beyond its years. 10/10.",titanic
"O filme é extremamente e curiosamente igual o que aconteceu no afundamento real, mais o que faltou foi o navio quebrando ao meio, e é isso.",titanic
"The movie titanic is immersive in its story as it takes two people who are both completely different in class, one is poor and the other is very rich, they both want something the other does not. My favorite part about the movie was the Visual effects and the scoring of the film. They both provide a more genuine experience for the audience and make the people watching the dynamic of Jack and Rose.",titanic
"92%. 11/2/23. 2nd watch in last year, but hadn't seen in ages before then. Love this whole story of Leo's character making his way onto the boat and then him and Rose falling in love. Feel like it was the right amount of development in the love story for them to seem genuinely in love before the boat crashes. Then the last 1.5 hours are awesome with the response to them hitting the iceberg. Surprised the audience rating isn't higher. 5/5 rewatch",titanic
Titanic is one of the most heartfelt movies I've watched. And I watched this for the first time in my friend's garage. I've always been interested in the Titanics history and this movie adds to that.,titanic
I have rewatched this movie a few times only because it has switched streaming services a lot. I am a Titanic fan and learned most about it on YouTube. I love what James Cameron did with the story. He took Titanic and they still told some of the story in the movie and added a Romeo & Juliet to it. Basically Titanic + Romeo & Juliet type of movie. I love that he did that with the movie. Honestly one of my favorite 90s movies. Most movies I like are from this decade because how good it was.,titanic
"This film is so much good, its simply incredible, the scenes with the ship sinking are exceptional, the CGI is incredible, everything is wonderful, James Cameron made an incredible trouble as director",titanic
It's 2023 & I just watched it again last night. Better than ever. An unprecedented technical triumph of cinema directing & acting performances that will live on forever.,titanic
"How can this movie be anything but 5 stars. Progressive storyline that follows along with the path of the ship. Amazing highs, lows, music, and cinematography!!",titanic
one of the best movies of all time with excellent visuals and cgi although the romance is a bit of a distraction from the main part of the story the film is based on,titanic
"Brilliant movie. Great attention to detail, historical accuracy and also uses a story that can keep the audience entertained. Only 1 cliche in the entire movie and it wasnt even that bad.",titanic
"Simply put, one of the greatest movies of all time. The soundtrack, the special effects, the cinematography, the story telling, a masterpiece by any measure yet the interweave together seamlessly.",titanic
"Such an emotional story, the music was beautiful. I also love the way they tied in modern characters to the story of Jack and Rose. The story had me wishing that jack was real, and had survived with rose. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie and would recommend it, although I would keep your eyes open to skip a few scenes or at least look away with younger audiences.",titanic
"Titanic - 10/10. It baffles me that people bash on this film just because it became a cultural zeitgeist. Titanic was everywhere and anywhere. People who've never seen movies went to watch it and owned it on VHS/DVD/Blu Ray. People who were cinephiles would go watch it in theaters almost monthly. History on the Titanic got a huge boom of interest and museums began to invest more and teach more on what happened on that fateful day. The movie won 11 Academy Awards, tying the record. It became the biggest box office hit for a while, and the first billion dollar movie. It ran in theaters worldwide for nearly a whole calendar year. And all this, was thanks to the genius and perseverance of a dedicated filmmaker, James Cameron. When the usually R rated content director wanted to make a sweeping PG-13 epic that was gonna be half a romance film and half a disaster film, many looked at him different. But Titanic became a cultural film because it connected with people in many different ways. Not only was it about romance and the ship, but it was also about classism, sexism, ageism, greed, and the bright and dark shades of human nature in desperate times. Its such a deep blockbuster, and one that wasn't designed to have sequels. All of this is encapsulated within one film, and its so impressive that every time you revisit this film, it feels like you enter a journey and are transported to those times. Cameron's film is one of those movie you need to see to believe!",titanic
"Good movie, the length of the movie is definitely worth it for how much content you are getting. Well executed classic movie with lines that have been quoted for decades.",titanic
"A masterpiece, pure and simple. It wasn't the dialogue or script or story which carried this film through -- it was the sheer experience, Cameron's striking ability to put us into the seat of the poor passengers on the lifeboats watching their fellow man suffer horrific tragedy. Cameron is known for his accuracy, and that combined with a flawless execution makes this film 5 stars for me. If you complete this movie and think otherwise, I honestly question your judgment.",titanic
"Iceberg scene is full of thrill and strength, There was a Japanese bureaucrat called Hosono, the sole Japanese on board, who regrettably got taken for a Chinese.",titanic
"This was a Cultural Event like Endgame, Gone With The Wind, Doctor Zhivago or Star Wars 1977. It was one of those things everyone saw and defined an era. And it still is amazing how strong this holds up and is an All Time Classic. The special effects are jaw dropping and as much as the CGI is praised, most of this is practical effects and sets. This gives it such a strong tangibility that CGI soaked disaster films or poorly done 70's disaster films don't have. This has epic, lavish, and eye popping moments throughout with the ultimate eye Candy being Jack & Rose's chemistry. Everyone is really good in this but what sends this over the top is those two and Old Rose. Their chemistry and Leo's Charm is amazing. Add on an iconic musical soundtrack for the ages and you can see why this is so strong. The editing is masterful as well as this a mix between a remake of a Night To Remember with a Romance film but never forgets it's a Romance Epic first and stays focused on its leads the whole way never diverting to pointless side characters or subplots and only diverts to tell the factual events of the journey. It never gets sucked into pointless destruction or carnage but always has a purpose and this owes a great debt to A Night to Remember. The only minor issue is the first half is a bit slow mainly because Jack and Rose are apart and not together. Add on the titanic journey telling also and it os slow. However once they meet and their journey's become intertwined it moves much faster and the patience is rewarded with a grand moving ending. Everyone should see this once. I will say remember this is a romance epic more than a factual retelling though it is very faithful to the facts. A Night To Remember is still the best movie for showing purely what happened on the voyage. Watch Both.",titanic
"After so much time, i finally risked this one from my classics bucket list, and well, it's a good film, with a clichê plot, but a solid theme. There were only some problems with the dialogs from the 2 main characters, mainly the Rose's ones that could be slighty changed. The music also should be used more often during the plot, and the secondary characters had 0 development during the film. But overall is a good film, or I might say a classic.",titanic
"I’d write a long review, but everything has already been said. Terrific movie. Hard to watch because of the realism of the tragedy. I recently went to a Titanic exhibit in NYC and the movie is extremely faithful to the real look and the real personalities of the true ship. Cameron made the perfect movie.",titanic
THE BEST MOVIE EVER I must say if you dont watch this movie you will be seriously be missing out! I watched this with my friends and it is now our favourite movie 🍿! Watch it trust me!,titanic
"In the epic romance-drama ""Titanic,"" which chronicles one of history's most tragic events, Billy Zane's block-buster performance as Cal Hockley brings a compelling antagonist to the forefront of the film, elevating the storytelling to new heights. Zane's portrayal of the arrogant and possessive fiancé, Cal, is nothing short of captivating. He flawlessly embodies the character's entitled demeanor, leaving a lasting impression on the audience with his compelling portrayal of a man consumed by wealth and status. Throughout the movie, Zane's commitment to the role is evident as he brings depth and complexity to Cal, making him more than just a one-dimensional villain. In scenes with Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet's Rose DeWitt Bukater, Zane's commanding presence shines, creating intense and emotionally charged moments that further intensify the movie's central conflict. His interactions with the other characters are riveting, making Cal a formidable force to be reckoned with. Zane's ability to evoke a range of emotions from disdain to sympathy for Cal is a testament to his incredible acting prowess. He portrays the character with such conviction that viewers are both repelled by his actions and intrigued by the inner turmoil he displays. In conclusion, Billy Zane's block-buster performance as Cal Hockley in ""Titanic"" adds a layer of complexity and depth to the film, complementing the gripping love story at its core. His portrayal of the captivating antagonist is an essential element that contributes to the movie's enduring status as a cinematic masterpiece.",titanic
"What a master piece! I love Leonardo, and he is pretty cool. Jack and Rose's relationship almost makes me cry, especially when they fall into the sea. Jack told Rose to never give up, even though he may die. Unfortunately, he is dead. I love them. Jack and Rose. best couple I have ever seen.",titanic
"At first we all think the same thing, ""If this movie isn't done right... It's just disrespectful to all the poor souls lost in the tragedy."". I think it PERFECTED the music, romance, characters, design, pacing, etc. The main ""villain"" you could call him, did not die. It showed what measures everyone had to take in order to get in a boat. Of course there are some scenes here and there that makes you go, ""Why?"". This movie has only a little fingers-worth of mistakes. All the deaths make you feel sorrow or it made you think about how this really happened. Throughout all the deaths I nearly sobbed in all of them. What a beauty of a movie. MUST WATCH.",titanic
"I've watched Titanic several times, dating back to the late 90's as a kid. After watching on Blu-Ray, I've gained a new appreciation for it. This is a very long movie, one you may even want to break up into two viewings. It's not the norm, by any means. With that being said, it's not perfect. But it's based on such an important moment in history. I'll be honest, it gets a pass in some ways because of that fact. If it was a movie about a random ship or just a romantic drama in general, it wouldn't have quite the same impact. The movie features excellent performances from DiCaprio and Winslet. Their romance on screen is believable and endearing. The back and forth between that tragic day at sea in 1912 and modern day works well and adds a layer of depth that takes it to another level. The sets of the infamous ship are well designed and it makes you feel like you're there in each moment on board. The iceberg scene and sinking are harrowing to watch. Even though a lot of the story is made up, it adds more drama and entertainment, which is fine with me. Overall, it's a great film from James Cameron. It's a classic now, and it holds up rather well.",titanic
"Love the movie but please, Mr Cameron, do give credits to the original - I know you used a LOT of parts from it. Love scenes beautiful but Titanic had more to offer, more true love. A night to remember! All the fans - A Night to remember is a must see!",titanic
"It's a beautiful, epic love story set against the backdrop of one of the most tragic events in history. The acting is superb, the special effects are groundbreaking, and the music is unforgettable. I first saw Titanic when I was 12 years old, and I was immediately captivated by the story of Jack and Rose. They were two people from different worlds who fell in love against all odds. Their love was forbidden, but it was also all-consuming. I couldn't help but root for them, even though I knew that their story was doomed. The sinking of the Titanic is also depicted in a very realistic and suspenseful way. The film does a great job of capturing the terror and chaos of the disaster. I felt like I was right there on the ship, watching it all unfold. Titanic is a film that I can watch over and over again. It's a timeless classic that will continue to be enjoyed by generations to come.",titanic
If you ever need to test you are human then look no further then this films final moments if you don't shed a tear then you maybe a robot I joke but it has to be said this is one of the most epic mind blowing disaster movies that is shot through a lens that sweeps across the luxurious interior of the main vessel to which the film is aptly named after. It's almost like a virtual time capsule not only dose the director make you fall in love with the trip of a lifetime he leaves you knowing that you to could have shared the fate of the poor souls who simply wanted a taste of the ship they claimed to be unsinkable. The romantic leads are perfectly cast so well cast that they came to symbolise in our minds what true love looks like for a whole generation If you haven't emerged yourself in the epic film making that is James Cameron's Titanic take the plunge immediately.,titanic
"A masterpiece. This movie is made of tears. I cried probably a million times. James Cameron is just an incredible director. A classic, and will always be incredible.",titanic
Ordinary and and utterly predictable piece of storytelling. Special effects are great but that doesn't make up for this bloated and dull movie. How it won the best picture oscar is anyones guess.,titanic
It’s overrated however that doesn’t mean it’s bad. I always enjoy Leo’s playful character. Final statement is that it was a big piece of wood.,titanic
My all time favourite. I have loved this film since being a child and will continue to do so for the rest of my life.,titanic
As much as I wanted to like this film it appears it's main focus is the love story between Jack and Rose. Totally took away from the story of the Titanic. Not my cup of tea I'm afraid.,titanic
Visually it was stunning but why did she throw that beautiful emerald in the ocean. That was stupid. She could have sold it and fed many homeless pets and kept them sheltered in the winter. Cameron is like that though. Like Wilkes bill paxton said “eat this” to the alien before he shot him. Right. He’s really gonna take time to do that. Alien was better. But aliens was still 4 stars.,titanic
I'M ALWAYS SAYING THIS: THIS FILM -Titanic (1997) IS A MASTERPIECE IT SO ICONIC THE DEPRESSING ASF ENDING AND POOR ROSE HER LIFE WAS SAD ASF,titanic
"This movie is so good I watched it 7 times.But,it was disturbing. Like the blood,the way how Rose's trickster try to catch her and Jack hanging out and dying by ending his life is disturbing.It also looked too real. The crying children,the final flooding,grand staircase flooding,people dying,it just looked way too real. By the way Jack could fit on the door I still wonder why they chose him to die.",titanic
"the titanic is always a nice movie to watch on a day when you don't have much to do. it captures you in love, and suspense throughout the movie!",titanic
The Iconic Character Rose is very much my favorite. This movie was very much helpful for creating back all of my drawings again. Can't be thankful for this movie to Jame Cameron. Also a special thanks to Late James Horner and Celine Dion for scores and the song. This movie is my best birthday gift ever to me.,titanic
"Titanic. Review. 1997 Agosto 18 en la espera de una de las historias que mas me llamaba la atención desde que primera vez vi un libro 3D de el Titanic en una tienda de libros de Plaza Las Americas en los 90's. James Cameron luego de entregarnos filmes como Aliens,T2 y True Lies, tuvo el atrevimiento y ese pensamiento ambicioso de hacer una de las historias reales mas conmovedoras en la historia de accidentes de barcos, este fue el caso de el Titanic, protagonizada por Leonardo Dicaprio y Kate Winslet en lo que es la mejor pelicula Dramática y romántica en la historia del cine. Esta ocación fue totalmente diferente, remasterizada a la septima potencia, en Imax por primera vez en la historia y para colmo 3D. Asi fue la experiencia por 10ma vez en una sala del cine... si asi como estas leyendo TITANIC es la pelicula que mas veces e ido al cine en mi vida 9 veces en el 1997 y una ultima vez en Imax 25 años despues en su aniversario en el mismo momento donde The Way of Water sigue haciendo historia, ahora vamos a lo que tanto espere hacer. El 12 de abril de 1912, el gigante ""insumergible"" RMS Titanic partió en su viaje inaugural desde Southampton, Inglaterra, para nunca volver a ver tierra y arrastrando más de 1.500 almas hasta el fondo del océano con él. La historia de Cameron cuenta una historia dentro de la historia original, uno de los personajes es Rose, una joven criada por una rica familia. La historia es contada como un flashback por esta misma mujer, ahora anciana, en la actualidad, a medida que se descubren artefactos del Titanic en el fondo del mar, esta mujer ve algo que una vez le perteneció. Se reúne con el equipo de exploración del Titanic para compartir sus recuerdos del viaje en el Titanic hasta el trágico día en que se hundió el barco. A partir de ahí, Kate Winslet interpreta el papel de la joven Rose. También entra en escena Leonardo DiCaprio como Jack, un joven pobre con un don para las artes. Él y Rose se encuentran inesperadamente y gradualmente se enamoran. No es nada original, pero la dirección es conmovedora. Realmente llegas a conocer a ambos personajes y quieres que estén juntos. Un romance como este necesita conflicto para que sea interesante.Ciertamente hay mucho de eso. Viene en la forma del prometido de Rose, Cal protagonizado por Billy Zane, nos enseña las diferencias de clase entre ella y Jack. Me encanta la historia romántica de esta película, pero lo que merece una mención más detallada son los efectos especiales. El amor y el desastre se encuentran, y no me refiero solo a la trama. En otras palabras, Titanic es un híbrido de película romántica y película de desastres. Esta es una mezcla inusual e irregular de géneros, pero sorprendentemente funciona muy bien. Si lo piensas bien, el peligro que implica el hundimiento lento del Titanic añade más conflicto al amor que florece al final de la película. No es solo un regalo para los ojos. Aún así, las escenas que tienen lugar una vez que el barco choca contra un iceberg son tan asombrosamente realistas que rivalizan con escenas de películas de desastres más orientadas al suspenso y la acción. Como era de esperar, esta es una película romántica y llena de suspenso, ya sea por separado o simultáneamente. En la superficie, parecen dos películas diferentes pegadas en el medio, pero en realidad son lo mismo en la segunda mitad. Fue una experiencia cinematográfica increíble. Es una de esas historias cinematográficas de las que no puedes quitar los ojos de encima. La mejor manera de concluir esta reseña es mencionar al director. James Cameron, conocido por dirigir The Terminator,Avatar y The Way of Water,Aliens,True Lies y The Abyss, trae una magia cinematográfica similar a Titanic pero agrega un toque igual de romance, algo que nunca esperé de este director. El resultado es una película de la que podría estar realmente orgulloso y que los fanáticos podrían disfrutar una y otra vez por decadas. Sin dejar atras la mejor canción en el universo ""My Heart Will Go On"" por Celine Dion y recordarles que fue nominada a 14 Oscars ganando 11 de ellos incluyendo Terminando mi enorme Review les dire que esto fue un espectaculo audiovisual y tuve que esperar 25 años para poder hablar de esta manera de Titanic en Imax y en un Review, definitivamente Titanic es el mejor filme en la categoria Drama en la historia. Clasificada: S 10/10 Masterpiece!",titanic
"I don't understand the hype this movie gets. Yes, it's a great film, but it's a little long for my liking. And this is most likely just me - but I wasn't too interested in the story. BUT I STILL CRIED AT THE END.",titanic
"It's a movie about a sinking ship, it had to be good, and it was. I really liked this movie because it's very simple but also very big in production and all, but it has a simple story, and I liked that. It's just a romance that's about to die, and it did not lose itself which was nice. Good movie.",titanic
"This is such an amazing movie that pulls at your heartstrings. More awe-inspiring is that the set itself was almost built entirely, albeit with smaller dimensions and some structural changes, to reflect that of the actual ship itself. This lends the viewer to a much more realistic experience, not to mention the fact that the chemistry Leo and Kate have with one another is unparalleled and makes you forget that you’re watching a movie.",titanic
"Titanic es una de las mejores películas tanto de James Cameron como de la historia en general por evidentes razones. Se trata de una historia de romance y tragedia que supo retratar bien la tragedia ocurrida en El Atlántico. Tiene muchísimas cosas a su favor: un excelente guion, muy buena producción, excelente diseño de vestuario, gran elenco con buenas actuaciones, una bella banda sonora, buena dirección y la lista puede seguir y seguir sin parar. Se trata de toda una obra maestra del séptimo arte que todo amante del cine puede disfrutar. Mi calificación definitiva para esta película es un 10/10.",titanic
Titanic is just simply one of the best movies I’ve ever seen from beginning to end I was invested in jack and rose’s relationship with each other & the people on the ship,titanic
I remember seeing this in the theater when I was in 7th grade. Everyone around me was bawling their eyes out. Never let go Jack!,titanic
"This movie about a horrible person and a poor man who somehow falls in love with her. I don't know how anyone can come out of the movie liking her, especially when she does what she does at the end of the movie.",titanic
"This movie established a lot of emotions and visuals on a very grand scale. The scenes with Jack and Rose are just well written which you WILL feels right after they start to interact with each other. Pain, happiness, excitement, panic, satisfaction, passion and many more can easily be identified by watching this movie. They is way to much more to talk about this movie like the director, actors and crews behind the scene working to make this masterpiece. Thank you.",titanic
"Just came back from 25th anniversary screening. Love, courage, survival. I watched ""Titanic"" 25 years ago at the theatre with surround sound and stadium seating-it shook me to the ground. I bought CD ""Titanic"", i coloured my wavy hair in Rose' red and people at work and strangers told me i looked like Rose for awhile. It is still my favourite love story of all time. There was an influx of information on technical mishaps in the movie, historic documents uncovering real Titanic story and corruption behind the tragedy, discussions about Jack's chances of survival, Rose using Jack for her own survival....Very informative, but for me personally only love story remains eternal and unstained.",titanic
Honestly the negative audience reviews puzzle me. This is one of the greatest movies of all time! The 3hrs fly by and you are left with a profound sense of understanding the real tragedy this movie portrays. My only gripe was the last scene (no spoiler here) seemed unrealistic.,titanic
"Just an absolutely great movie. Action, love story, Kate winslet is hot and sexy as f*, and provides commentary on social issues like class disparity. Note to self, be more like jack and less like the douchebaggy fiancé",titanic
"Why the heck did the internet start hating on this movie? Yes, it's too long, and you feel that run time. Yes, some of the acting is rough in places. Yes, we over-memed the ""Jack, I'm flying!"" bit. But other than that, this movie rocks. I love Leo and Kate's chemistry and that scene where they first meet is really good. The action is really good and you can really feel for everyone on board. Like, this is a truly tragic event that gets all the awful details glossed over. 0verall, great movie.",titanic
"Titanic is simply a masterpiece. This movie has it all. A tremendous score, deep emotion emphasized by fantastic performances, and incredibly gripping and high-stakes action. There is really something for everyone here. Before I continue my praise of the film, I think it has one glaring weakness: the present-day plot. For me, this just did not work all that well. I understand that it was implemented for the main story to have a more emotional impact, but it was not needed. It added almost thirty minutes to the runtime, which could have been used for more character development in the story or to have a more streamlined plot. Not to mention, the acting in this section was lackluster. That might be a hot take, but it was something that I noticed during my watch. Back to the positives. The score is magnificent here. The minute I finished the film, I had an urge to put on this score to be transported back to the Titanic. That does not happen very often to me. The performances are great all around. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry was perfect. They played off each other so well and really sold this emphatic and rapid love the two shared. The movie spends a lot of time building their relationship and the payoff at the end is worth every second. Billy Zane was an over-the-top asshole, and even though it was cheesy at times, it worked for me. The other ancillary cast members did well, including Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Bill Paxton. This film is really two movies put into one and both of them work excellently. The first half is a charming and cute love story that spends a lot of time on character development, laying the background for motivations and personalities. While this half may have been my favorite, it is slightly outdone by the second half, which is a gripping and suspenseful survival action story. This section is brutal, showing large scale panic and hysteria while also having some incredibly horrific deaths. The chaos was infectious and very scary to watch. Both halves create a great sense of emotion in the audience and complement each other very well. Overall, this movie had twenty-five years of hype and critical acclaim to live up to, and I am happy to say it passed expectations. Since leaving the theater, I cannot stop thinking about it. Score: 96% Verdict: Masterpiece On a side note: I did see this movie in 3D during the twenty-five-anniversary re-release. While it was great to see it remastered in 4K, I do think the 3D was poor and unneeded. This did not affect my grade however, since it was not originally designed as a 3D experience, and they 3D did not really take away for my enjoyment.",titanic
Titanic has been my favorite movie ever since I was 5 years old.at 30 I jumped at the opportunity to see this on a big screen and wow the story moved me so much more as an adult as sit did when i was little and I couldn't stop crying. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet shine as Jack and Rose and will forever be made the the academy ignored them especially DiCaprio. A Briliant beyond brilliant film.,titanic
A very awesome movie. Even for a movie made back in the 90s it is awesome. I can only guess why it's rated below 70.,titanic
"The ultimate Romantic Tragedy, even though Leo also did “Romeo + Juliet”. Seems a bit distasteful to cheapen this situation with a love story for teens. My clear preference is “A Night To Remember”. A lot of you will be turned off by its being in Black And White and that it is British. Which by the way so were a majority of passengers and crew,",titanic
"Just saw Titanic in the theater for the very first time for its re-release. Absolutely one of the best movies ever made. I cried at the end despite knowing for years how it ends. Probably in my top 5 favorite movies ever, and I'm not even someone who cares for romance movies all that much. A perfect movie through and through. Go see it in the theaters this week in 3D while its still there.",titanic
"Titanic is that rare work of art that leaves an imprint on a generation and continues to permeate our culture, decades later. The undeniable chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet, breathtaking visuals, costumes, and storytelling truly make it the greatest love story in cinematic history. Additionally, the somber music of James Horner masterfully ties together James Cameron's work.",titanic
IMAX has had the pleasure and opportunity of hosting 25th Anniversary Film days before Valentines Day. Rose was amazing. Jack was the man. 3D glasses are way cooler now. Graphics here are phenomenal. I’m thinking this classic has some of the greatest theater audio ever.,titanic
"My favorite song from this is ""My Heart Will Go On"". But, this totally caused me to dump my highschool girlfriend who I dated once, because my mind was so screwed over. Guilty AF.",titanic
"Damn you James Cameron, I didn't want to like this, but I just cannot hate it. I can't really come up with anything that was done poorly, it truly deserves the positive reception.",titanic
"Titanic is a classic epic romance that deserves a 9/10 rating. The film boasts stunning visuals, capturing the grandeur of the Titanic and the beauty of the ocean. The love story between Jack and Rose is touching and timeless, and their performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are powerful. The film's score is haunting and adds to the emotional impact of the film. The historical setting of the Titanic's tragic sinking is also well-researched and depicted. Overall, Titanic is a must-see film that stands the test of time as a masterpiece of cinema.",titanic
"Yawn - how long is it going to take for this boat to sink? Oops, sorry, just gave away the ending. You don't have to watch it now!",titanic
"Titanic is my favorite blockbuster of all time. The score is maybe the best ever, the original song by Celine Dion is iconic, the sound design and mixing is insane, the VFX better then some these days, the production design is the best ever put on screen, the editing is perfect, the costumes are gorgeous and so much more, i will definitely be seeing this movie for the first time in theatres next year with the rerelease. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are the most iconic duo of all time in this movie, James Cameron's direction is perfection and if that ending doesnt make you cry full out, then i dont know what to say",titanic
"One of the greatest films ever made. I did not really appreciate it when I was younger, but watching it now as an adult I can appreciate the superb craftsmanship and timeless quality of the film. It's absolutely magnificent.",titanic
"A good movie,had a weird part in it. Best part of this movie was Leonardo Dicaprio. I think that the romance and the history in this movie are really good, I also think that the sets in this movie are very well done. I think that this movie is a great movie that anybody who is interested in the Titanic should watch. One of my favorite movies. I love it so much! Overall a Great movie, -10/10",titanic
People are crazy. They rate Avengers so high and they rate this masterpiece low? This is beyond absurd. You guys should encourage great filmmakers like this one not stupid ones like the super hero franchises. For the love of god.,titanic
"Superb film that the classic is, well directed, lovely visuals and cast and developed characters and lovely storyline throughout, wouldn't say it's my most favourite film ever but a film everyone had to see at least once",titanic
"Stunning in its depiction of the Titanic and its inevitable sinking, this film is strongest when focusing on the boat and the secondary characters. The betrothed-rich-girl-meets-poor-boy love triangle at the center of the plot comes off too cliche and simplistic for this movie work on all levels.",titanic
"« Titanic » est un film culte qui a marqué l'histoire du cinéma avec sa réalisation exceptionnelle par James Cameron, sa musique inoubliable signée James Horner et la performance mémorable de Leonardo DiCaprio en Jack Dawson. Les répliques et scènes emblématiques, ainsi que les effets visuels révolutionnaires pour l'époque, contribuent à son statut de classique du cinéma. Cependant, le film présente quelques moments où les choix des personnages peuvent sembler dérangeant. Malgré ces légères imperfections, « Titanic » reste un chef-d'œuvre incontournable.",titanic
"This film hasn't aged well for me, but I still believe it's a good romantic story. The main characters have good chemistry, the film juggles the star crossed lovers theme well, and the historical Titanic sinking still looks good and rings realistic. Well worth a watch though I don't believe it's the greatest movie of all time or anything like that.",titanic
"Felt a bit 'dated' to me after watching it recently, but it's still a very good movie as far as I'm concerned. Very good visuals for back then, very good acting performances, Kathy Bates in particular, and a killer soundtrack.",titanic
A perfectly written film that honors the one who lost their lives. Titanic tells a romantic story that also tell one of the most horrible disasters in history that will never be forgotten.,titanic
"O filme é simplesmente fenomenal! Fantástico! A trilha sonora, a fotografia, as atuações, os efeitos visuais...enfim, simplesmente maravilhoso. Fico Triste que os críticos reduziram a nota do filme de 89℅ para 87℅.",titanic
"A very good film. Romantic and moving at the same time. Keeps you in suspense from the start to the end. A very handsome main role actor, good music, beautiful costumes, and an interesting set design. A must-see.",titanic
"One of my absolute favorite movies. I think James Cameron is a sack of crap but oh boy did he makes a smashing good film. The story feels so real and the special effects and practical effects have aged really well. The story, drama and tension are all done really well, too.",titanic
"Good story w/compelling characters and tense action. The special effects are excellent, which is good because in this story the visuals are a greatly-needed element. I know I'm a bit late adding this review, but I couldn't help adding my thoughts when I saw the audience score which, IMO, is too low for this brilliant film. I call it a film because it's not compelling due to *only* action. The class elements of the narrative hold up a mirror to society's ongoing obsession with us/them-ism.",titanic
"Masterpiece emotional, humanistic has complex and interesting characters with amazing cinematography and special effects,shows true empathy and sacrifice,fantastic performance from Dicaprio and the way the tragedy is portrayed is shocking and heartbreaking. This is a film classic and an amazing drama, romance and human tragedy disaster movie fit into one perfectly with incredible performances all around a must-watch and deserves all the critical acclaim it got. 10/10",titanic
My favorite movie of all time! This movie is just a masterpiece. Based on a true story as far as the iconic ship and it's history but the movie is just so well put together.,titanic
"The acting in this movie is pretty rough at times and the destruction at the end was lackluster. However, it is undoubtedly an epic film. Rating - Fine",titanic
"I've always really liked this movie. It's really well done, and has such a great cast. Watching it some 20 years later it still holds up. Great movie!",titanic
"Titanic is, in general, a very heart-breaking movie. Although it is known for the romance and the two famous stars on the movie posters, Titanic has a historical background that is also very interesting to be observed and taken into consideration. Rose was being forced to marry someone she hated to save her family from economical disgrace, Jack was treated with despise when he was among the wealthy people on the ship, and, in the end, the poor people (many of whom were people of color too) were left to die while the boats were being filled with the aristocrats. I've watched this movie dozens of times but I always manage to get very teary. In my opinion, both of the protagonists are charismatic (specially Jack, my beloved), and I love their scene on the ship's bow because the soundtrack and the photography are great. Of course I would be way happier now if jack had not died, but we can't have everything so I accepted his fate. I don't think the movie is completely perfect because you can always find things that are susceptible to criticism (it is still white-centered, for example). However, I still recommend this movie even though it is really old and everyone might have already heard about it, but for those who haven't: that's a unique experience you are missing out on.",titanic
"This could be one of my more generous five stars but it is rare that I remember the location, who I was with, and the circumstances surrounding watching a movie in a theater 25 years ago. There really aren't these kind of universally shared cinematic experiences anymore, as even Marvel movies are ignored by large segments of the population, and certainly the three hour sweeping historical dramas are out (sorry Ridley). Titanic provided a much more comforting rewatch all these years later and it had been awhile as this maybe the first rewatch I haven't had to switch VHS cassettes halfway through. I could easily make a case for Leo and Kate as my favorite actor and actress since this film, as I went on to appreciate so much more of their work. Cameron creates a visually stunning film, the scope of which still looks and feels just as impressive today. The strong nostalgia as well as the factors listed above make it easier to look past some of the stilted dialogue and implausible plot choices, but even judging this film on a purely technical level, I think it would still be hard to get me more than a star lower. 9.5/10 Side note: I never appreciated until this watch that Rose Dawson may have also been the finest art collector the world has ever seen.",titanic
"Even after more than 24 years since its release, ""Titanic"" still proves itself as one of the greatest movies of all time. The storyline is arguably one of the best ever, and the depiction of Jack and Rose's star-crossed love on the ill-fated Titanic ship is so heart-warming and breaking at the same time. It has every element of an amazing movie, and this film still lives forever in movie history.",titanic
"This is my absolute favorite movie. It's such a classic. There are some parts that may need to be skipped for kids under 13, but aside from that, absolutely incredible film!!!",titanic
This is an obvious classic film filled with beautiful displays of how far a relationship between star crossed lovers can go in a short period of time the romance is to die for and it is highly recommended that you watch this movie despite the amount of time it takes these characters have there relatable moments and are great to watch,titanic
"I don't care what anyone says negative about this movie. It is my favorite movie. It's got action, it's got romance, it's got tragedy, it's got historical fiction, and it even has a little humor (partially because it's a mainstay of pop culture). I think it deserved all the love it received at the time of its release and needs to be remembered as THE epic film of a generation.",titanic
"👍 Although occasionally overdramatic with its romance, a great movie overall that captures the essence of a fairy-tale love story while also showing the tragedy of a disaster to great effect👍",titanic
"One of the most classic films ever put to screen. Just the music itself makes you revisit it and topped by the visuals, performances and direction. Although the modern day setting could have been used a little lesser in the film but besides that a great-great film.",titanic
"Summary: In 1912, a huge and fancy cruise, the Titanic, was voyaging from England to New York. It was a cruise that carried people's dream of new life in America. There is also a romantic story that happened on the cruise. There are two main characters in the movie, Jack and Rose. Jack was born in a poor family. He won the Titanic's tickets from a bar. He was full of dreams and was excited about having a new life in America. Rose was born into a wealthy family. However, her family went broke a few years ago. Her mom wanted to maintain a wealthy life, she wanted Rose to marry a rich guy who Rose doesn't love. Rose was reluctant to get married to him and she decided to jump off the boat to kill herself. However, Jack walked by and saved her. At first, Rose wasn't happy about Jack saving her life. For Rose, a life of pretending to be rich seemed superficial to her. She almost felt suffocated in life like this. Jack's appearance was a beam from the sun to her foggy heart. Jack showed to Rose that even the people who lived in the third class were not rich, but they owned the real happiness. Meanwhile, Jack and Rose got to have more chances to stay with each other, and they fell in love. While they were dreaming for their future in America, they didn't know that the danger was getting closer to them. Analysis: Titanic is a movie with romance and history. It is adapted from a real story. All the story starts from Rose's memory in the Titanic. By recalling the scene, it brings the audience back to 1920. Through highly restored scenes from the Titanic, the audiences can experience the life on the Titanic. I think Titanic was popular at that time for three reasons: fancy special effects, the romantic story, and that it was based on a real story. Wallace Hartley was a real violinist who played with his band their last song on the Titanic and in their lives. That is the most unforgettable scene for me: while the boat was sinking, the violinists started to play ‘Nearer, My God, to Thee' on the cabin. They didn't rush to try to get a spot from the rescue boat, instead they chose to play this music to calm down people. Here are two different aspects of why they chose to play this song. Firstly, the song can bring people peace. Secondly, the song mentions the coming death, and it acted like a funeral song because most of the people would die because of lack of rescue boats. Through playing this song, people can realize that death is not the end and God is always watching over his people, and they would be able to meet God and their beloved one. Eventually, the violinists sacrificed their lives for playing music to the people. Titanic is not just a movie but also a society, it shows people from different social statuses experiencing that disaster together. There are heroes and villains. The violinists are heroes. Their music brought the Spirit and peace to the boat, and they even all sacrificed themselves in the end. Critic/Recommendation: I think Titanic is an awesome movie, not only because of its reality but also based on what they wanted to share with the audiences. Titanic is a romantic movie with a disastrous ending. In addition, I think the director is good at mixing every element in the movie. As I mentioned before, the Titanic is not just a cruise, it also represents a society. Through people's words and actions, I can learn from history and experience the love between Jack and Rose. The special effects were a hit at that time. When the movie came out, special effects were not as common as now, also most people have never been into that background of the early 20th century. The movie lets them have the chance to experience life at that time which can make the audience more involved in the movie while watching it. Even after twenty-two years have passed its special effects are still a legend. Due to its perfect story and fantastic special effects, I rate it 5/5 stars. I highly recommend people go watch the movie.",titanic
"if you're interested in the Titanic and like romance movies this is the movie for you. The sets are beatifully done, the characters are great and the story is great. There are a few historical inaccuraces, but they are minimal.",titanic
"The movie Titanic is a forceful presentation of a historical event. the film presents a story of romance and tragedy among the passengers and crew, it shows that feelings of love and equality are experienced in all the socio-economic classes on the ship, the costumes and the details of art describe the time period very well, the music and film sets show the feeling of the various characters in the film. The actor Leonardo DiCaprio leads the cast, his performance by him completes the success of the film, and will make the audience fall in love with the film. Finally It is a movie, that people can see several times and they will have the same experience.",titanic
"James Cameron's Titanic is the kind of big budget blockbuster that makes audiences both love and hate Hollywood films. From the hate angle, it feels deeply unsettling to use a horrific maritime disaster as the platform for a love story involving the dashingly handsome artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the wealthy but dissatisfied Rose (Kate Winslet). In addition, like so many Hollywood epics, it tends to drag on much longer than it needs to. On the love side, there's nothing else quite like it. It's a well-executed and thoroughly engaging exploration of the struggle between the classes and the idea of enduring, eternal love that will draw the viewer into the drama regardless of whether the audience wants to be drawn in or not.",titanic
"Beautiful Romance with innovative set design and characters with the depth of the Atlantic Ocean. While it might be long, Titanic sailed past my expectations to unveil the best romance movie I've ever watched",titanic
"Undoubtedly the safest movie I have ever seen in my 20 years on Earth. No Marvel movie, true story, or sports movie even attempts to compare to this movie. It pulls every string attached to your heart and brings about the deepest of emotions. Exceptional.",titanic
"I saw this as a kid and didn't like it but I totally get why. Watching it back finally as an adult, I can see the appeal. The romance is engaging and the big set pieces with the sinking are so well done. It does drag at points and there was totally room for Jack or to at least switch places back and forth.",titanic
Although looooong and some cgi is a little out of date I really enjoyed watching this again some 20 plus years after first seeing it in a cinema .. I wonder how it would look if made today?,titanic
"Even though it was pretty cheesy, the love story massively worked and kept me engaged for the whole 196 minute run time. Worth every second and will have you shouting at your screen by the end.",titanic
"An absolute classic with so much emotion, heart, and a spirit of adventure. Titanic is a true classic with some master class performances. It’s pace can be a bit tedious for some, but I had no issue with it. The score is such a classic too. A must see!",titanic
"My most favourite film of the modern films in the last 30 years in my top 3 of all time, can watch this masterpiece over and over and not get tired. The chemistry of Leo and Kate was for sure one of the key reasons it was number 1 of all time until Avatar. A film that can truly be experienced on the big screen a great score from James Horner along with the great theme from Celine Dion",titanic
"There are several dumb plot conveniences, though they are quickly overshadowed by the spectacle and powerful performances that ""Titanic"" brings along with it. This classic movie has revolutionary CGI for its time, with the classic story of star-crossed-lovers transitioned to the Titanic perfectly, this film remains one of Cameron's best works ever put on the big screen. The story is well, and the actual romance is done questionably but still makes enough sense. Overall, a great film that truly captures the horror of what occurred on the Titanic, providing several tear-jerking moments, especially towards the end.",titanic
"Titanic is a movie which perhaps suffered from receiving too much positive critical attention. The dialogue is melodramatic and the characters sometimes make questionable decisions, but as a spectacle, the movie is very successful, with lavish sets and impressive set pieces. Temper your expectations, and you will likely enjoy the film.",titanic
"CMON! I was expecting more from the characters. I grew up in America and this is a movie commonly referenced in conversation. Sadly, it is a reflection of American taste and depth more than it is a beautiful movie. James Cameron extends greater consideration towards budget, set design, a panning camera, and scope of grandeur and disaster than what I identify as the real conflict worth tears. Not one person survived with a Third Class ticket. The rich negotiate, offer leverage, hide in spacious lifeboats and Rose survives instead of Jack. This is an accurate story but should be received as a tragedy instead of a romance. What lines of memorable dialogue are there? They pass the plot along, the ship must sink. There are memorable visuals, the set is magnificent, and the scene where voices stop and are frozen is excellent. However, unlike the iceberg, there is not enough depth.",titanic
"While a bit excessive and grandiose at times with some uneven sequencing (and I can see how some might think that about it), it is undeniably a very well-directed and executed film with fine acting and writing overall. I bought into the romance, the series of events, and details behind the portrayal of the sinking of the ship! It definitely wasn't bad, nothing is really bad with Leonardo DiCaprio in it too!",titanic
What an epic story that combines a love tale with the tragic events of a disaster in human history. Still fresh years after... The only poor part is the predictability of this love story that carries many elements from classic romcoms..,titanic
"Incredible in its large-scale production. The performances are good. What it largely suffers from is an often juvenile script--though even that does have its moments of expertise. In all, it is an exciting sweeping adventure!",titanic
"It's a film that everyone should see once in their lives. Its brilliant cast elevates the movie even more. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio have undeniable chemistry. Titanic makes us experience tragedy in two ways. The tragic death of thousands of people losing their lives, but we also experience it in the way it affected Rose personally. It's been over 20 years since the film debut, and it still holds up just as well and is an all-time classic.",titanic
"If director James Cameron had concentrated on his thesis -- that the sailing of the Titanic basically marked the transition from 19th Century ideas of classism to 20th Century notions of egalitarianism -- and had ignored the boring love story, this could have been a far more impactful feature.",titanic
"Absolutely beautiful, and an immediate masterpiece for Cameron. Titanic boasts some great visuals and unforgettable performances, with effective emotional use that would make any viewer teary.",titanic
"Not a bad movie. Does a good job with the romance bit. Still a bit flighty there, but, I'd recommend it so that you can at least say, I've seen it. It has good performances. The story's just a bit cliche.",titanic
SOOO UNREALISTIC this would never happen we all know the real titanic didn’t actually sink 1 the earth is flat 2 big ships don’t sink the end.,titanic
"There is a trend happening more now than ever where people hate on classic films for the sake of hating because they are classic films and loved by the majority of the public. As I start this ""Re-watching and Re-visiting films"" series, I will be repeating this many times. I do not quite get people's issue and ""beef"" (to put it less sophisticated) with Titanic. Is it one of the best movies of all time? Not quite. Is it a really well-done film that stays in our minds years and years after seeing it for the first time and if it is playing on a TV channel, you put it on? Why, yes. I understand the bother with a ""pointless"" love story plot line for dramatization but what's funny is that it works with the strong performances and magical chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. But what I want to focus on in Titanic is the little scenes. There are many scenes where the tears uncontrollably fall down your face. Towards more the last section of the film where the boat officially sunk down, there is a shot from sky above of all the passengers screaming and flapping around the water. Up close, it is suffocating hysteria and from afar, it is just one sound in the middle of the gigantic ocean. People being left to die (as there are themes being shown of the lower class being purposely cast aside and the rich prioritized) and people coming to terms this might be their last breath on earth. Playing with camera angles intensifies a small scene for a viewer and makes that small scene stand out in a 3 hour movie.",titanic

This is a 98/100 for me. It's a masterpiece. How... how is this movie getting this lower rating from audience scores? One of the best movies of all time.,titanic
"Masterpiece! I don't care what any idiots think, this movie is amazing. Despite its bizarre length of over 3 hours, I was consistently entertained and rarely bored as well as inspired by the incredible acting performances, eespecially DiCaprio and Winslet, a beautiful love story between Jack and Rose that's filled with excellent chemistry and so many great scenes like where they first meet, the score is simply incredible and it does such a great job of displaying the Titanic. The set is magnificent and the contrast between rich and poor as well as society expectation and free will is handled really well but the moment the ship hits the iceberg, it's near perfect. You truly feel the tension and fright as we see the effect of the sinking on so many people as well as the (let's be honest) terrible organization of the crew and the visuals hage aged super well. Hard to believe it's a 1997 movie. And gosh that last half made me cry, seeing the hopelessness of many of the victims and of course, Jack's death. I'm still pissed that Jack died but that bastard Cal survived. But still, incredible. It's definitely slow at times. You really feel that 3 hour runtime and I think less time could have been spent on the fictional (but well developed) love story and more on the Titanic itslef and seeing the different people om board. Still, incredible (A)",titanic
i don't know why the audience score is as low as it is but this movie is 100% one of the best movies ever period,titanic
"Titanic came out over 20 years ago and to this day is still a huge phenomenon. It is still just the third highest grossing film ever (however part of that comes from the 3-D rerelease) and still is quoted and talked about constantly to this day. Now is it a perfect movie, no. Is it overrated, absolutely. But there is still such a great nature to it that makes it honestly hard not to love (at least slightly). The first 90 minutes of the movie is essentially just a chick flick (and the writing is not the best) but it has such a charm to it and Leo and Kate’s chemistry is so likable that you can’t help but enjoy it (even if it isn’t the best). Then the rest becomes a completely different movie almost, as we see the titanic sink. This is where the movie really becomes phenomenal. The effects done and the cinematography and shots we get are great. Even though I’ve never really liked James Cameron much as a person you deny that he is a great director, especially with action scenes like the end to the movie. The entire last half of this movie is completely thrilling to watch and also it is heartbreaking when (spoiler alert) Jack dies (but you probably already knew that). I love this film a lot and even though it has its problems I can’t deny the power that this epic has.",titanic
MY FAVORITE MOVIE EVER!!!!!! A MUST SEE!!! When you watch this your jaw will drop to the ground😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲 and when it's over you'll just sit there speechless and watch the credits like WOW 😮,titanic
"Being older now, I can see how silly and formulaic parts of the story and dialogue are but I was amazed when I saw this in theaters as a kid. While flawed... I still think it's lots of fun and overall very good.",titanic
"I watched several previous versions of the Titanic story leading up to this viewing to increase my appreciation of the spectacle that is this movie, but it actually backfired a little bit as what it showed was that this version was more derivative than I had previously imagined. There had long been a definitive, historically accurate movie about the ship sinking and there had even been one where a love story is told while the ship sank as a backdrop. The good news is that this knowledge didn't really sully my experience at all; they did a FAR greater job here at capturing the sense of wonder that the ship provided its passengers, the love story was more compelling, they took the right creative liberties by creating high-quality antagonists and they did a better job creating a sense of foreboding with the sinking alluded to throughout the runtime. The main thing I disliked was the way they framed the narrative as nearly all of it felt clumsy, from the Old Rose narration sounding like she was reading off a piece of paper to the treasure hunting guy having conflicting attributes with his clearly-expensive effort to dig up artifacts trumped by knowledge he would've had beforehand, that some ship passengers loved each other. The movie would fall a bit short from a purely technical standpoint but it's still one of the greatest viewing experiences ever provided by film as a medium, so I'm giving it the full score here. Woohoo!",titanic
"Titanic is a movie of 19l7, directed by James Cameron. The 2 mains characters are Leonardo DiCaprio who play Jack and Kate Winslet who play Rose. They are both very good actors, at least in their roles on this movie. The film is about an old woman, Rose Dawson who saw that a specialist churches the « the heart of the sea » necklace, but it's not a necklace like the others, it's his. Then she went to meet him and tell him his story on the Titanic, with the beautiful Jack. The acting of the 2 mains characters is spectacular during all the movie. They simulate as well happy and fun moments than the saddest. They make you completely feel all feelings they want. Specials effects are outstanding and photography is really great for this time with the wreck of the Titanic is really well done specially when we see all the boat breaks. The famous and typical song of Celine Dion « My heart will go on » make this scene particularly unforgettable. Also the costumes like all the dress of women are so impressive. To conclude, the 3 hours of this film are unbelievable and you sure at 99% if you love romance story, that Titanic will make you cry. Warning : you can fall in love with Jack...",titanic
"Titanic is a very great movie with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as main actor. The film tells the story of two young people, Jack and Rose who fell in love during a trip on the titanic a huge cruise ship. But Rose is already destined to marry another man who is rich. In the night, the boat enters an iceberg in the ice cold water of the North Atlantic with 1,500 people aboard. The plot seems to be very absorbing because it's a real romance story who makes you cry ! There are amazing special effects who transmit different emotions. The photography is really incredible and absolutely breathtaking for a movie dating of 1997. Leonardo DiCaprio is an amazing actor and knows how to convey emotions. The script of the movie is realistic and thought provoking because the movie is inspired by a true story. There are music in a background who is very touching in different scenes. I recommend this film to anyone who loves drama and romance story.",titanic
"Titanic - 10/10. It baffles me that people bash on this film just because it became a cultural zeitgeist. Titanic was everywhere and anywhere. People who've never seen movies went to watch it and owned it on VHS/DVD/Blu Ray. People who were cinephiles would go watch it in theaters almost monthly. History on the Titanic got a huge boom of interest and museums began to invest more and teach more on what happened on that fateful day. The movie won 11 Academy Awards, tying the record. It became the biggest box office hit for a while, and the first billion dollar movie. It ran in theaters worldwide for nearly a whole calendar year. And all this, was thanks to the genius and perseverance of a dedicated filmmaker, James Cameron. When the usually R rated content director wanted to make a sweeping PG-13 epic that was gonna be half a romance film and half a disaster film, many looked at him different. But Titanic became a cultural film because it connected with people in many different ways. Not only was it about romance and the ship, but it was also about classism, sexism, ageism, greed, and the bright and dark shades of human nature in desperate times. Its such a deep blockbuster, and one that wasn't designed to have sequels. All of this is encapsulated within one film, and its so impressive that every time you revisit this film, it feels like you enter a journey and are transported to those times. Cameron's film is one of those movie you need to see to believe!",titanic
WAY! TOO! LONG! CMON THIS MOVIE IS SO GOD DAMN LONG I FELL ASLEEP AT LEAST TWICE IN ITS 3 HOUR SPAN AND MISSED LIKE HALF OF IT. JAMES CAMERON REALLY BLEW THIS ONE.,titanic
"Unpopular to say now but I believe that the movie was deserving of the awards and acclaim. Near perfectly executed popular entertainment. Thrilling, romantic, often very silly, and ultimately quite emotionally satisfying.",titanic
I think it is one of the best movies ever made. Really James Cameron Direction is at its best. I also read more about it here -> ,titanic
"I'm sorry for being so late to the party with this film, but now I understand why it has remained so popular. Everything is just perfect, including Winslet and DiCarpio's performances. Their chemistry has been so powerful that you can't help but giggle and cry at the same time (You have no idea how many tears I shed when the final scene happened). Furthermore, despite the fact that this film was released in 1997, the special effects are flawless. You can really tell that they worked extremely hard to make this film stunning. Thank you very much, James Cameron.",titanic
A 69%!!!!??? really people!???!! Wake up!! Putting a 69/100 rating for the third highest grossing movie of all time and the winner of 11! oscars. It's in these rare instances where I really question the audience rating on RT,titanic
"A somewhat cheesy romance is more than compensated for by the 1000 Watt star power of Leo and Kate, and James Cameron's one-of-a-kind eye for epic filmmaking.",titanic
This movie was literally supposed to be Rated R but James Cameron was able to negotiate a Pg-13 rating with the MPAA. This movie also has tons of language that isn't even okay for young kids.,titanic
"Yeah, Leonardo DiCaprio wasn’t quite there yet with great acting as he was in “What’s Eating Gilbert Grape”, but the production and soundtrack still holds up after 24 years, so that makes it worth a rewatch!",titanic
"Cameron's exquisite attention to detail in regards to the sets, costumes and of course the innovative CGI is what makes this film work. Also helping it along is the wonderful Kate Winslet as Rose and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack. She and Leo DiCaprio have amazing chemistry together as the fictional couple from different worlds. The way that sci-fi and horror director Cameron turns the Titanic into a monster when it hits the iceberg is something to see - the last fifteen minutes of the sinking is awesome to watch. What doesn't work? With so many amazing real life stories of the passengers and crew of the famous ship, James Cameron decides not just to ignore them, but create a rather foolish and preposterous tale about a missing diamond and filling out the supporting cast with cliched, silent film type characters (the snooty mother, an odious fiancé, a greedy publicity hungry shipping magnate) which takes away from the natural power of the famous shipwreck. Billy Zane is particularly bad here in a Snidely Whiplash-esque turn here as Rose's fiancé Cal Hockley, complete with an equally nefarious sidekick/right hand man played by David Warner. And Frances Fisher as Rose's mercenary mother Ruth, gives an icy, one-dimensional performance, like a scheming matriarch in a nighttime soap opera. Fisher is a much better actress than that. And Kathy Bates is criminally wasted as Molly Brown, who was probably the ballsiest passenger onboard. Her presence is muted here, but Bates works with what she's got. And the crew and second class passengers are pretty much ignored. We are left with the wealthy, entitled and elitist first class passengers and the naive, plucky and resourceful immigrants in third class. No one else counts. I also like Bill Paxton in his role as the fortune hunter Brock. But the film is infectious fun despite its glaring flaws; it's impossible to not get caught up in the sheer spectacle, from the treasure hunters using cutting edge technology to inspect the Titanic's rusty bones, to the excitement of a glamorous ocean liner making its maiden voyage, to the tragically dramatic wreck. The film still manages to impress.",titanic
"Perfeito. Incrível. Maravilhoso. O melhor filme de todos os tempos, não é atoa que continua no terceiro lugar entre os filmes com a maior quantidade de bilheteria.",titanic
"This movie is based on real events of the wrecked RMS Titanic, but adds to the love story that turns bad memories into good memories, a forever love that many people still remember until present. This movie is not just a romantic movie, it also portrays a lot of drama stories. The movie shows us that love and suitability are not the same thing. Jack and Rose's Love, people disagree, but in the end it can cause love anyway. There was one scene that I'm quite shocked when the boat was sinking, people were selfish tried to get on the reserve boat to survive, let the rich get on the reserve boat first, then the poor later. I watched this scene and felt depressed, that measure the value of people with money, there are two impressive scenes :1.Jack and Rose falling from a boat while the ship sank, which had to be in very cold water that there were a lot of deaths from the cold water in this scene, but Jack told Rose ""you had to stay alive"". In the end, someone came to help keep Rose alive, but Jack couldn't endure the cold so he died, which made me cry a lot. 2.when the boat was sinking, a couple of old men and women choose to end their lives cuddling and die together, I'm impressive and sad at the same time. This movie is very impressive for me with a good story, the spectacular scenes and the symphonic music that made I get into the mood of the movie very well.",titanic
"This movie is great. I get why people hate it but it is not overrated. The effects are great, the performances are good it's uniquely structured. A technical smash.",titanic
"Such an iconic movie. Does an amazing job at investing you into the relationship. Strong symbolism. The only thing I wish they did was keep in a few of the deleted scenes, they would have made an even greater impact and given the audience a better insight on the lower class in the time period. Amazing music and incredible acting from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Billy Zane's character is also very dislikeable and makes a perfect 'villain'.",titanic
"Just about the perfect block-buster with something for almost everyone. Romance, action, history, suspense all in one film. The acting was top notch and the story compelling. When judged for what it is, it is just about a flawless film.",titanic
"As a huge fan of both the ship itself and the director James Cameron, I naturally loved this movie, Leo & Kate's chemistry is just amazing too.",titanic
"A heartfelt story known all throughout the world of two unexpected and unwanted lovers on a luxurious voyage only to come to a ending that left a breath of coldness on the hearts of those who saw it. Like an iceberg, Cameron's ""Titanic"" shook the very core of my strings as if there was a tiny band playing a song to drift me into my own dreams. However unlike Jack, my dreams are very much still alive in my soul. Truly a classic for old times that will stand storms and tsunamis throughout the film industry for a very long time to come. The only iceberg this movie will face is if a remake would unexpectedly remove it's crown.",titanic
"""Titanic"" is an absolute classic that everyone must see at least once in their lifetime. It's astonishing visuals (at least on the blu-ray) are an absolute must-see, especially at the sinking scene which was done with an actual prop ship. James Cameron's masterpiece is absolutely wonderful and an essential viewing experience.",titanic
Titanic (1997) Director James Cameron jerks off for 3 hours in the form of a movie glorifying his hobby of deep sea shenanigans. Barely made it past the 57 min mark before completely losing interest and opting to walk my dog and go to bed. Would not recommend for anyone with things to do.,titanic
"This movie was amazing. Dazzling, romantic, and heartbreaking, it was terrible in the best of ways. The first half was absolutely magical to watch. The second half quickly morphed to a horror movie, as we watched Jack escape death countless times only to die in the stupidest of ways. HE COULD HAVE LIVED. You know it, I know it, we all know it. Rose was utterly stupid and watching her squander Jack's love just made me hate her. Jack was adorable, and he didn't deserve her.",titanic
"First of all, it is the cheesiest movie I have ever seen in my whole entire life. Secondly, I wasted an incredible amount of time watching this horrid love story (3h 4m)",titanic
this is my favorate romance movie of all time it makes me cry every time its just so charming leo gives you buterflys the whole movie,titanic
"TBH, I saw this film in the theater as a 16-year-old school girl ready to fall in love, and I still couldn't wait for the movie to end. To this day, I have no idea why it was such a success. But at least it gave the world Kate Winslet. And the melodramatic shipwreck sequences will - for a little while - awaken you to a desperate contemplation of your own mortality.",titanic
"Titanic's best qualities come from its two main leads and visual effects. James Cameron proves with this film that he may be one of the best action directors ever, as even though the writing could've been improved on, he manages to create one epic thrill ride with cinematography and visual effects.",titanic
One of the most overrated movies of all time. I gave it a rewatch for the first time in 20 plus years and it is still boring! Two hours in and the boat still hasn't sunk. Cameron and DiCaprio were living off their names on this one. It does not hold up well.,titanic
"One of the movies you should see at least once before you die. It's pretty spectacular. The ""love"" story is pretty cheesy. They knew each other for like 2 days. Get a grip already. And there was no record of the guy. I'm convinced the old lady made it all up but it's still a good movie. It's a big time commitment at 3:15 though.",titanic
I finally have seen titanic and it was pretty good. A wonderful story about the ship called the titanic and a girl named Rose played by Kate Winslet falls in love with Jack played by Leonardo DiCaprio. The acting in the movie is very good. I loved it. I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. He's a great actor. The part where Leonardo DiCaprio dies towards the end is very sad. I recommend checking out titanic. Such a pretty good film.,titanic
"Flawless. Absolutely flawless. Incredible acting, writing, visuals and more. A true tear jerker that is based off the tragic events of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, this film could not be more flawless. Leonardo nailed the performance which is why he is my favourite actor of all time. The emotions and visuals and performance of the cast was absolute incredible. Highly recommended watch.",titanic
"This movie deserves The Diamond Medallion Of Freshness, mainly since it's a powerful film. Characters: 5/5 Story: 5/5 Acting: 5/5 Special Effects: 5/5 Direction: 5/5 Cinematography: 5/5 Soundtrack: 5/5 Overall: 5/5",titanic
"I thought this movie especially sucked because it appeared that while he was dying in the freezing water, all she would have had to do was move over. Then, they both would have stayed warmer and survived. Instead, she just lets him sink in the ocean, promising she'll make it.",titanic
"This movie took an idea that really seemed like it could be a dead end and nailed it. In my eyes, this is an instant classic with a very sad script, as one could expect. I have never understood the lower rating and hate for this film, is it because there is a lot of romance involved for a movie one would not expect it in? Or that it's long?",titanic
"Titanic is an epic, romantic classic that is beautifully made. The relationship between Jack and Rose is very well acted and thus the long runtime, the development of the story, and their characters is done really well. Once the Titanic crashes, the action is impeccable. While still capturing Jack and Rose's romance, you get to see a near accurate depiction of the Titanic sinking. As the climax builds, you get to see the panic that spreads throughout the ship. I would definitely recommend this film, especially to anybody who likes historical dramas and natural disaster films. Also, the depiction of the rich and poor and how they interact with each other is a common theme throughout the movie, which provides a consistent moral throughout the movie which is very neat as well. Titanic is a great movie, that deserves 5 stars.",titanic
"A truly masterful film in every way. Not only does Titanic prove how skilled and elegant Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is and the sensational direction skills by James Cameron, but is retells the story of the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic with total and full command; as the tense athmosphere breaks through its windows and its emotional weight is staggering. A film that takes you on an adventure and pours doses of romance and really makes you care about every living soul that perished 15. April 1912. Must-watch!!!",titanic
"I don't know how to feel about this. On the one hand, I loved a lot of things. I loved DiCaprio and Winslet in the film. They give great performances. Billy Zane is a ton of fun to watch. At some points you hate him, but there are times where you feel sympathetic to him. But by the end you hate him. Also Kathy Bates and Victor Garber. Love them. They are awesome. I loved the effects. Still very convincing. However as per usual with James Cameron, I don't like that much of the story. The first half is very cliché. It's your standard romance that you've seen a million times. But it does it well. I had fun with the it. But it was very standard and the script wasn't very good. Throughout the whole film. It's not the worst, but it feels kinda 90s. But the second half is where the real indifference is. On the one hand, it looks great. Some of the things are pretty awesome. And while I hated the fact that I was horrified and had a ton of anxiety. But that was on intentional. But something about it felt wrong. If this wasn't real I wouldn't have felt as bad. But it felt a bit to dark and exploitive for my taste.",titanic
"With James Cameron pulling off amazing CGI, and a young Leonardo DiCaprio manning the main character, you have a recipe for a film that is visually pleasing, and at the same time has admirable acting.",titanic
"Kinda sad movie. I love the ocean, but this makes me a bit scared of it! Wonder if parts from shipwrecks ever wash up onshore. I've never seen any at Fort Tilden NY and I'm there a lot in the summer. Sometimes I'll step out into the water there, plant my feet, and pretend I'm a post. My girlfriend holds on to my back like she's a barnacle. In fact, I'm a plant, and she's a plant. I love her so much. Sometimes when I can't sleep I'll nudge up next to her so I can feel her chest expand and contract with her breath. It's comforting. Sleep barnacle. I thought the movie could've been shorter. Agree with the earlier comment re. tighter editing.",titanic
"Pretty good, also Leo's fuggin hot in this one. Does anyone know what he meant when he said the drawing for the lady was an offering to the most esteemed hostess of Jacobracon 2020? WEEEEIRD",titanic
"An absolute classic. This movie tells the story of a man in the mid to late 1900’s with a disability. He accomplished incredible things through out his life, including fighting in the military, opening a business and receiving many awards. He becomes famous and finds and fights for the love of his life, Jenny. This movie is the perfect example of not judging a book by its cover, as young Forrest was beaten up and mocked as a kid only to achieve more than his bullies ever did. This is an amazing movie, I definitely would recommend it.",forrestgump

"Forrest Gump isn’t just a movie—it’s a cinematic masterpiece that has earned its place as one of the most beloved films of all time. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is filled with warmth, emotion, and unforgettable moments that make it feel as close to perfect as cinema can get. At the center of it all is Tom Hanks’ legendary performance as Forrest, a man with special needs whose pure heart, determination, and unique perspective allow him to stumble into some of the most iconic events of the 20th century. But what makes this film so powerful isn’t just Forrest’s story—it’s the way the movie introduces and builds the people around him. From Bubba and his dream of a shrimping business, to Jenny and her complicated but heartfelt relationship with Forrest, to Mrs. Gump and her tough-love wisdom, every character feels fully alive. Zemeckis allows us to engage with them, understand them, and ultimately fall in love with them. The writing and storytelling are nothing short of brilliant. The script blends humor, heartbreak, history, and hope seamlessly, creating a film that feels timeless. Iconic lines like “Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get” have become part of our cultural language, but the movie goes far beyond catchphrases. Its military storylines, its portrait of love, its message about perseverance and destiny—it all resonates on a deeply human level. What could have easily come across as offensive or unrealistic—a film centered on a man with special needs—was instead handled with such grace and sincerity that it brought audiences together. Rather than dividing, it united viewers through empathy and love, showing us that innocence and kindness are often stronger than intelligence or power. Nearly three decades later, Forrest Gump still holds up as one of the greatest films ever made. It’s a movie you can rewatch endlessly, and each time it finds a way to move you all over again. Verdict: A masterpiece. If you’ve never seen Forrest Gump, you might as well be living under a rock. This is a film I recommend to everyone, and it will always remain a gold standard in heartfelt storytelling.",forrestgump
"Forrest Gump is my second favorite movie of all time, and for good reason. It’s one of those rare films that sticks with you long after the credits roll — funny, emotional, uplifting, and quietly profound all at once. Tom Hanks delivers a performance that’s nothing short of iconic. He completely becomes Forrest, a character so sincere and genuine that you can’t help but root for him every step of the way. The journey he takes — from the football field to the Vietnam War to running across the country — is wild, touching, and deeply human. And after watching it… I couldn't stop making Bubba jokes. 😭 The shrimp scene lives rent-free in my head. It’s hilarious and heartbreaking all at once — a perfect example of how this movie blends comedy and emotion so effortlessly. The film is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving real history into Forrest’s personal tale in such a seamless way. The soundtrack is perfect, the pacing never drags, and by the end, you’ve laughed, cried, and maybe even learned something about life, love, and destiny. “Life is like a box of chocolates…” and this movie is one of the sweetest. 9.8/10.

"A bit overrated. It sort of just ended with no conclusion really and it is quite controversial leaning in with American History, but still solid with great acting from Tom Hanks and Robin Writht.",forrestgump
"Forrest Gump is one of those movies that leaves a lasting impression, even if it leans a little heavy on sentimentality. Tom Hanks is phenomenal—his performance as Forrest is tender, believable, and full of heart. The film does an amazing job of blending personal moments with sweeping historical events, and somehow it all feels cohesive. The soundtrack is great too—every song fits the moment perfectly and adds to the nostalgia. That said, some parts feel a bit too on-the-nose or emotionally manipulative. Jenny’s arc, in particular, could’ve been handled with more depth. Still, it’s a beautiful story about love, fate, and perseverance, and it’s easy to see why so many people connect with it. Not quite perfect, but definitely unforgettable.",forrestgump

Rating: 80%. I recently re-watched this film and thought I'd rate it. Its an entertaining film and I love that it mixes in all sorts of historical events into the plot.

AND I still have it on VHS! This movie will forever hold the test of time because of the award-winning acting, the historical nuggets, , the emotional roller coaster, and even the basic CGI that is not very noticeable (Kennedys and Nixon’s Mouths).

"Eu tenho uma lista muito seleta de filmes que eu considero verdadeiramente mágicos. Esse é um dos filmes dessa lista. A história é levemente clichê e previsível? Sim, um pouco. A narrativa, em partes, é melodramática e emocionalmente manipuladora? Às vezes. E este filme, mesmo imperfeito, devia ter levado o Oscar de Melhor Filme no lugar de ""Um Sonho de Liberdade"" (1994)? Provelmente, não. Mas é indiscutível, inegável e inevitável a magia de ""Forrest Gump: O Contador de Histórias"". E essa magia é resultado da inovadora mente de Robert Zemeckis, um diretor que, ao longo de sua carreira, frequentemente arriscou e levou além as tecnologias de efeitos viuais, da linda trilha sonora de Alan Silvestri e da simplória e, ao mesmo tempo, profundamente complexa atuação de Tom Hanks.",forrestgump

"Robert Zemeckis, director of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Tom Hanks as Forrest Grump makes us believe that there are genuinely good people out there in this cruel and harsh world. Mrs. Grump often tells Forrest, ""Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you'll get,"" a sentiment that resonates not only with Forrest but also with the audience watching the movie.",forrestgump
"Sometimes, life is full of unexpected twists, just like Forrest Gump famously said: “Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get.” This movie is not just about one man’s life but a journey through significant historical moments and a wide range of emotions. Forrest Gump is directed by Robert Zemeckis in 1994 with a protagonist Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, a man with below-average intelligence but a pure heart. With a mix of historical fiction, romance, and inspiration, this movie blends humor, drama, and profound life lessons. Forrest Gump is a must-watch film that beautifully captures themes of love, and destiny. The story follows Forrest Gump, a kind-hearted man with a low IQ but an extraordinary ability to be in the right place at the right time. From his childhood struggles with bullying and leg braces to becoming a college football star, serving in the Vietnam War, and even influencing major historical events, Forrest’s life is nothing short of remarkable. Along the way, he remains deeply in love with Jenny Curran his childhood friend whose turbulent life contrasts sharply with Forrest’s. He also forms meaningful friendships with Lieutenant Dan Taylor, a war veteran, and Bubba Blue, a fellow soldier who inspires Forrest to start a shrimp business. The screenplay masterfully blends humor, emotion, and historical events to create an engaging narrative. The story is unpredictable flows seamlessly, keeping the audience captivated from start to finish. The film’s ability to integrate Forrest into real historical footage such as meeting U.S. presidents adds an immersive and unique touch. Tom Hanks delivers a career-defining performance as Forrest, embodying his innocence, sincerity, and optimism effortlessly. His portrayal won him an Academy Award for Best Actor and remains one of the most memorable in cinematic history. The artwork is beautiful and realistic for that era. The background music sets the mood very well. Along with songs from famous artists of that era such as Elvis Presley and The Beatles. The editing in the story was flawless. For the Themes and Messages is about Destiny vs. Free Will, Love & Loss, Perseverance & Optimism, Historical and Social Commentary. Forrest Gump is more than just a movie, it’s an emotionally moving, deeply inspiring, and beautifully crafted masterpiece. With its timeless storytelling, outstanding performances, and thought-provoking themes, it remains relevant even decades after its release. Who Would Enjoy It? -Fans of drama, romance, and historical fiction. -Viewers who enjoy character-driven stories with emotional depth. -Anyone looking for a motivational and feel-good movie. -And it is suitable for people aged 13 years and over because it is a movie that contains scenes about drugs, sex, and inappropriate language. If viewers are under 13 years of age, adult supervision is advised. Rating: (5/5) – A Must-Watch Classic Whether you’ve seen it before or are watching it for the first time, Forrest Gump is a film that leaves a lasting impact and reminds us that sometimes, the simplest people teach us the most profound lessons about life.",forrestgump
"The best types of movies are the ones with some underlying message or meaning. To me, this movie portrays the message that a person is best defined by the actions they take. The character of Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, symbolizes this message. Hanks is perfect for the Forrest role in this movie and his acting combined with a great soundtrack and beautiful picture makes this such a wonderful movie. I also think that the storyline is very well-written, encapsulating the idea that ordinary (even less than ordinary, in Forrest’s case) people can accomplish and do remarkable things. The character of Forrest is one of my favorite movie characters I have ever watched, and my favorite scene comes when it is revealed how he spent his shrimp earnings. Forrest invested and gave away his millions of dollars, and chose to spend his time cutting grass for free. This specific scene symbolizes the character of Forrest and the movie itself, proving that any person is capable of great things and gratitude. Lastly, this movie has some remarkable quotes. Some of these stuck with me, I will list them below. ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.” I like this quote because it symbolizes the randomness of life that can come to anyone. ""But at night time when there was nothing to do and the house was all empty, I'd always think of Jenny.” I like this quote because it shows that there will always be times of peace and quiet, and what you do with that time can define you as a person. ""My mama always said you've got to put the past behind you before you can move on.” This is just a good life lesson. I’d rate it 9.5/10.",forrestgump

"Filme: Forrest Gump: O Contador de Histórias Assistido: 1-9-24 Elenco:       Modelo: ventura omance Duração: 2h 22m Ano: 1994 Minha opinião: Depois deste filme, começou uma nova fase na vida de Hanks de Sucesso atrás de Sucesso e solidificando sua carreira Brilhante. A Espera de um Milagre, O Resgate do Soldade Ryan, Náufrago, O Terminal, O Código Da Vinci, Prenda-me se For Capaz, Elvis,.... Um filme Espetacular. O filme começa com Gump criança que usa armação para poder andar, considerado com QI abaixo da média, parece que tem autismo, quem sabe se o filme nos dias de hoje seria colocado. E com o inicio das aulas o único amigo(a) é Jenny (Wright) e pelos outros sofrendo bulling. E Jenny se torna seu amor platônico e real, do ínicio ao fim do filme. Onde em todo o filme ela segue seu caminho de loucura. Onde ela quando criança seu pai a molestava, assim crescendo com seus traumas. Mas ela foi a que incentivou Gump no inicio depois as coisas vão acontecendo em sua vida, como um tabuleiro de xadrez. Ela diz para Gump “CORRA” e com este comando ele entra no time de Futebol Americano e na faculdade. Até o dia que se alista no exercito, e la faz amizade com Benjamim (Mykelti) que conta as estoria dos camarões e chama para serem sócio, mas ele acaba morrendo. E Salva Tem. Dan da morte. Após isso ele começa a treinar tênis de mesa sozinho e acaba indo para China e vencendo representando os EUA. Ganhando medalhas do presidente, entrevista ao lado Lenon, até o dia que o exercito o dispensa. Gump vai atrás da promessa dos camarões. Mas nada da certo até o dia que vem o tem. Dan e eles acertam e se tornam milionários e ainda acionista da Maçã. Neste períodos ele encontra com Jenny, mas sempre acaba seguindo seu caminho Hipe, drogas, Rock Hall, até o dia que aparece na sua casa de Gump, que estava lá desde morte da sua mãe. Jenny vai embora novamente até o dia que retorna, mas com uma surpresa pois ela trouxe seu filho Forrest (Osment) e ela com uma doença terminal pela vida que levou. Até quando ela parte, e Gump vive com seu filho que relembra da sua infância. Uma interpretação impecável de Hanks, de Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti. Um elenco que teve muita sinergia. Roteiro e enredo Parabéns, como algo fora do comum, que digo da estoria, se torna um sucesso. Vale apena assistir? Com certeza Nota: 10",forrestgump
I really enjoy watching Forrest Gump once in a year. It shows me once again what a great Actor Tom Hanks was and is. The Story also motivates me to do everything I can to achieve my dream. (Even if the story is often unrealistic) It also gets me on the emotional side with these great acting performances. A true classic.,forrestgump

This movie had so many scenic shots where you see the actual space and it actually compliments the characters and their relation. Emotionally its strong. and the music just does its magic making you connect with the drama even deeper and stronger.",forrestgump
"What more is there to say about this classic? Zemeckis’ directing is perfect here, so many moments through Forrest’s life, aligned with moments in history, work so well. Forrest feels like a wacky side character to the other characters in the tale which to me is a unique feeling when watching a movie and I loved it. Not to mention Hanks’ acting here is sublime once again.",forrestgump
"Another incredible classic - a touching and well-thought-and-written drama starring Tom Hanks at his best (He won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his amazing portrayal of Gump). Forrest Gump tells the story of a mentally challenged man who achieves great things, all during a difficult time in America.",forrestgump
"Very seldom does a movie rise above the moniker of ""great"" and into the realm of magical -""Wizard of Oz"" ""Casablanca"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" come to mind. Equally rare can an actor play such a difficult role and become so immersed that we truly forget they are a famous person up there on the screen pretending - Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man""- Daniel Day Lewis in ""Lincoln""- Heath Ledger ""The Dark Knight."" When these two elements coalesce it captures our imagination as only the best of cinema can. The historical documentation combined with the personal journey we witness over decades is engrossing and heart warming. While Hanks portrayal is a tour-de-force in subtle acting, it's the supporting cast of Gary Sinise, Robin Wright and Sally Fields that allow this film to become the wonderful magic show from beginning to end. Few will watch this movie and not be impacted by it's humanity for years.",forrestgump

"This movie sums its self-up in a line from Tom Hanks in the movie. "" Life is a box of chocolates, you'll never know what you are gonna get."" Why does this sum it up perfectly you may ask, why it's because the fact that it is a guaranteed delight and surprise at every corner. I also have a liking for history, and the Vietnam War scene is nearly identical to the actual Vietnam War. There're many delightful characters such as, Jenny, Lieutenant Dan, and Bubba. I very much like this movie and is definitely in my top 5 best movies of all-time list.",forrestgump

"A true heart-warming film with a great story, great acting and there are heartfelt moments from beginning to end that's makes you want to cry. Forrest Gump is not only a great film but it's a true highlight in Tom Hanks' Career on par with Big, Cast Away, Catch Me If You Can, The Polar Express, Splash & the 1st Toy Story.",forrestgump
"This movie is the ideal movie, its fun, entertaining, funny, sad, and everything in between. It does have a little bit of a detour on it's plot a few times, but I feel that almost makes sense given the main character of the movie. All in all, this is one of my favorite movies, and I would 100% recommend it!",forrestgump
"I hadn't seen this movie in a very long time, and as I recall, I never thought it was all that, so had no desire to rewatch it, but decided to last night. I think I enjoyed it more this time. It's certainly put together well and it's pace never flags, and Tom Hanks, despite the annoying accent, gives a very touching performance. I remember being put-off by what I originally conceived of as the antifeminist message—that Jenny had to love an intellectually and emotionally challenged man or she would die. But this time I felt the message was just more that she was so incredibly damaged from the abuse she suffered as a child that she had no idea how to love a man who was good to her. (I also felt this time that the child clearly did not belong to Forrest, but that she thought the kid would be best of with him so when she found out she was dying, she told that little lie). Anyway, a decent film and did make me tear up a bit. I still think Shawshank was the better movie and should have won all the Oscars.",forrestgump
"An inspiring epic tale of a man who appears hopeless and stupid to many but proves people wrong time and time again through his compassion, determination and unequivocal honesty.",forrestgump
"As Forrest's exploits are expertly (and oftentimes nonsensically) woven through some of history's most famous events, the messages of the film - that love knows no bounds and that ordinary people are capable of extraordinary things - remain in their purest forms throughout the film. Hanks' portrayal of this unlikely American icon lends credulity to his character's extraordinary feats, keeping the unbelievable nature of his exploits closer to fantastical rather than inconceivable. Gump's genuine nature grants us the perfect accents of simple humor and heartwarming emotion, simultaneously ameliorating the audience from over-the-top gags and overly saccharine moments. The iconic soundtrack stretches across decades worth of music's most influential names, though at times can be a little too ""on-the-nose"". The selections could have benefited from a deeper dive into some of the artists' catalogs in certain spots. Understandably, the idea was to capture certain moments in time through music, and in that regard, it does its job perfectly. When infused with Alan Silvestri's epochal score, the film's musical presence becomes another character whose presence we should all appreciate. ""Forrest Gump"" is what every moviegoer should get treated to whenever they step inside a theater, and its rare mastery of storytelling is why it remains one of the 20th century's classics. It should continue to stand the test of time in the minds and hearts of movie lovers.",forrestgump
"In high school, my teacher put this movie on after the majority of my classmates were done with the final. I'm a super slow test taker, so I had to complete the final while this movie was playing. I was beyond dead last completing that final from how hard I was laughing at this movie. Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite comedy movies; if not my favorite.",forrestgump
"I will state that this is definitely an acquired taste and not everybody will enjoy it, but, personally I think this film is a classic masterpiece. The right mix of funny references from past events in America that provide good fun and also the right mix of emotional scenes that captivate the viewer's attention. Robert Zemeckis nails everything from the amazing music, the feel of the movie, how they make Jenny have a struggling life that she can't fix and Forrest unintentionally rising up in power. Overall, Forrest Gump is a perfectly crafted piece of art that can be enjoyed by even the youngest viewers.",forrestgump
"I've only just watched this film (2024) I never really thought I would like it, and only watched it cos it's a famous film that I've never seen. To my surprise I really enjoyed it, I was glued to the screen the whole time, it even made me cry at the end. Fantastic.",forrestgump

"""Forrest Gump stands as a cinematic masterpiece, a tapestry of human experience intricately woven with threads of humor, heartache, and profound wisdom. Tom Hanks' portrayal of Forrest is nothing short of extraordinary, embodying the character's simplicity with a nuanced grace that tugs at the heartstrings. The film's brilliance lies in its seamless navigation through decades of American history, as witnessed through Forrest's unique lens. From the Vietnam War to the Watergate scandal, each historical chapter serves as a backdrop to the protagonist's unassuming yet impactful journey. It's a poignant reminder that even the simplest among us can leave an indelible mark on the tapestry of time. What truly elevates Forrest Gump is its ability to evoke a spectrum of emotions. Moments of laughter are juxtaposed with scenes that delve into the profundity of life's unpredictability. The iconic line, 'Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get,' encapsulates the film's central theme – the beauty found in embracing the uncertainty of existence. Alan Silvestri's enchanting score complements the narrative, evoking nostalgia and punctuating pivotal moments. The film's visual storytelling, aided by groundbreaking special effects that seamlessly place Forrest in historical footage, adds a layer of authenticity that is both captivating and innovative. Forrest Gump isn't just a movie; it's a timeless exploration of the human spirit. It invites us to reflect on the interconnectedness of our lives, the power of love, and the profound impact we can have on the world around us.

"All Time Classic. The Question I feel this poses is while it shows all the life lessons we learn throughout life and is what makes it so relatable is what is it that dictates how we learn those lessons, fate, luck, or something in between?Masterfully acted and edited. This beautifully weaves a Romance, Coming of Age Story, War, and MeloDrama into a sophisticated story that's never unfocused and is its own unique tone that really is one of a kind. The closest I can compare this too is this is like a Hal Ashby film but is 51% Drama and 49% everything else. Tom Hanks (Along with Gary Sisnae) is Masterful in this and is the best thing about this along with so many memorable sets and action pieces. The Special effects are incredible and some of the best out to screen. The music is outstanding as well. This moves at a super fast pace throwing so many different memories of Forrest's life at you but never feeling bloated or over the top. This definitely is sentimental and tender but it doesn't do it because of a lack of substance but because it's very relatable due to it covering so much about life's lessons in such a short period through the eyes of such a likable and relatable character. The only issue I have is its message is clear while being ambiguous. It leaves it up to you decide what life is and at times I wish it would've been a bit more clear about that because it's such a big purposely ambiguous message that can be hard to tangibly grab on too to make sense and decide. It can become hypocritical in the grand scheme if you think about it. But at the end of the day everyone should see this once though and make up their minds for themselves.",forrestgump
"It's definitely a well made, emotional and -at times- funny movie, but I don't really get what it is trying to do. My mum used to say the message is that ""the American dream is only for fools"" and I only recently realized that the movie is apparently not widely understood that way. Or is it? I am definitely not sure that was its intention. What am I supposed to take away from this film? Is it satire or is it just sentimental and corny?",forrestgump

"Excelente película, en mi opinión una de las mejores películas de todos los tiempos y el mejor trabajo de Tom Hanks. Es una película mágica, que cuenta una historia hermosa de una persona que paso por muchas dificultades en su vida pero que la sigue viviendo al máximo a pesar de todo y hasta logra ser la influencia (con o sin intención) de varias cosas utilizadas en un futuro como la frase ""shit happens"" o la camiseta con una cara sonriente; además de la gran cantidad de celebridades o estrellas que logro conocer debido a su alocada vida. Es una cinta muy entretenida, que pueden parecer varias historias que se conectan con el protagonista, contando como fue su vida desde que era un niño que sufría bullying hasta que es mayor y paso por varias cosas como ir a la guerra, jugar al ping pong, jugar al futbol americano, etc. Además, es un chico que cuenta con algunas personas importantes en su vida, como Jenny, su amigo Bubba, su madre y el teniente Dan; y al final termina perdiendo a gran parte de estas personas. Algo que hay que destacar es el soundtrack de Alan Silvestri, teniendo algunos temas que se volvieron icónicos. Por otro lado, los efectos son excelentes, por ejemplo en las escenas en las que conoce celebridades como a John F. Kennedy o John Lennon, las cuales están muy bien hechas. Por ultimo, las actuaciones son brillantes, principalmente Tom Hanks, quien en mi opinión hace el mejor papel de su carrera; además, tiene buenas actuaciones de Gary Sinise, Sally Field y Robin Wright. En conclusión, una excelente película que creo que todos deberían ver porque cuenta un historia hermosa, mágica, emotiva y entretenida que queda en los corazones de todo el que la vea.

"There's a scene in Forrest Gump that encapsulates the film. Jenny, who is dying from an STD, asks Forrest if he was scared in Vietnam. Forrest then tells Jenny about the stars in Vietnam, the sunset he saw from the shrimp boat, and the mountain lake from his cross-country run. Forrest even mentions a desert sunrise so stunning that he didn't know ""where heaven stopped and the earth began."" Forrest sees the beauty in everything. He took a question about fear and spun it into poetic gold. This is why we love him. His attitude and childlike wonder towards life represents humanity at its best. Something to aspire to. Based on the novel by Winston Groom, and adapted by the amazing Eric Roth, Forrest Gump is an opus about the power of optimism and how to endure life's pain. Forrest Gump masterfully depicts the hero's journey with amazing plotting and structure. It's a journey I want to take time and time again. Robert Zemeckis is a pro storyteller and crafts each scene with the right amount of humor, nostalgia, intensity, and human emotion. The framing device of Forrest telling his story is perfect. We get to live inside Gump's head and see a heightened version of reality from his mind's eye. It's a dream, fairy tale, magic trick, and memory all in one. Forrest Gump grew up in Greenbow, Alabama during the 1950s. Zemeckis paints Greenbow with Norman Rockwell idealism. Childhood is a time of wonder but Zemeckis doesn't let us live there Scott free. Forrest has to deal with a single mother, a low IQ, leg braces, and bullies. Zemeckis is genuine about the story he's telling. Only a director that earnest can pull off a joke about Mrs. Gump banging the school principle and make it work. All of these characters come from a place of Southern Boomer love and affection. The genius of Forrest Gump is the contrast between Forrest's naive innocence and Jenny's cynical life crisis. We get two opposite journeys in one. Forrest is the vanilla protagonist and audience stand in. He's an ordinary man who experiences the extraordinary. Forrest Gump is wish fulfillment. He's a country boy that sees the world. He's the feather that floats in the wind. Forrest isn't focused on the destination, he's just in love with the journey. His heart may pine for Jenny and Greenbow but Forrest makes the best of where he is. He embraces the now. James Cameron once said that a movie doesn't have to be possible it just has to be probable. The byproduct of Forrest's low IQ and social awkwardness is that he has extreme focus. He can assemble a gun and play ping pong better than anyone. He can run from coast to coast and keep a pace. Forrest pops up in so many historical moments that we half expect him to reveal the Watergate scandal that led to Nixon's resignation. This explanation is enough for the audience. In the army, Forrest finds a second family. Bubba becomes a brother to Forrest. ""I gotta find Bubba"" is the ultimate heartbreaking plea. Lieutenant Dan becomes the mentor and father figure that Forrest needs. Dan is a no nonsense bad ass who challenges Forrest and grows to respect him. There's a scene where Forrest is recuperating at a VA hospital by enjoying ice cream. This moment is interrupted when Forrest receives a stack of ""Return to Sender"" letters that he sent to Jenny. This is classic Zemeckis. He gives you bliss one moment and breaks your heart into a thousand pieces the next. With Zemeckis we never know what we're gonna get. Lieutenant Dan goes through the crazy character development that Forrest doesn't. After getting both his legs amputated, Dan becomes a shell of himself. He's a cigar-chomping drunk with a crisis of faith. He hates that Forrest saved his life. Dan has a lot of reinventing to do. When Forrest buys a shrimp boat, Dan agrees to be his first mate. There's an amazing scene where Forrest and Dan survive a hurricane. When the storm clears, the duo have more shrimp then they know what to do with. Peacefully floating in the water, Dan thanks Forrest for saving his life and then makes his peace with God. Dan gets new legs and a new lease on life. Jenny spends the whole movie running from her demons. She tries to fill the void left by her abusive childhood and only half succeeds. She returns home to Greenbow but she's not ready to stay. She's not done running. Forrest is crushed and the only way he can deal with his pain is to run. He runs for three years and eventually his heart begins to heal. When Forrest sits at the bus stop at the beginning and end he's wearing the old pair of Nikes that Jenny got him. To Forrest, the little things in life are the big things. At the end of Back to Future, Marty is rewarded with a better life. Some people don't like this ending but this is classic Zemeckis optimism. Forrest goes through hell and he gets rewarded for it. This is the hope of the film. We want to believe that every disadvantage contains an equal or more powerful advantage. We want to believe in the spiritual concept that all things work together for the good. When Forrest reunites with Jenny it's the healthiest we've seen her the whole movie. She has finally found peace. At the end, Forrest walks his son to the bus stop and the movie comes full circle. Zemeckis doesn't just wrap a present, he puts a bow on top. 1994 was a great year for film and against distinguished competition Forrest Gump won six Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Screenplay, and a second Oscar for Tom Hanks. Is Forrest Gump really that good? I believe it is. Alan Silvestri composed an amazing score and the film features a remarkable song list from the 1960s and 1970s. Forrest Gump may not be for everyone but it hit me right where I live. Robert Zemeckis and Eric Roth's ode through 20th century America is as sweet as a box of chocolates. And that's all I have to say about that.",forrestgump
"What a story, incredible. Robert Zemeckis tells a beautiful lifestory in like 2.20 hours, while it feels like 30 minutes. When the movie ends you just feel like you have seen a whole life of someone, the journeys, the struggles, the love and friendships and it all comes toghether so wondeful. What more is their to say about this Tom Hanks performance, just incredible. Robin Wright and Gary Sinise are incredible in this movie, as wall as Sally Field of course. The VFX are incredible, as well as production design and every other technical detail, such as editing. Man i miss a score like this one, so iconic and with so much emotion. The friendship and love that Gump builds in this movie all leads to such a beautiful emotional payoff, which made me cry so much. This is a story, that even if you are not the smartest, most beautiful or richest person in the world, succes finds you when it wants to find you.",forrestgump
"Absolutely amazing movie, definitely a favorite of mine, however a couple parts have aged really poorly. Especially the scene where Forrest explains how he got his name feels really unnecessary and uncomfortable in modern eyes.

Still an absolute classic and must see despite it's missteps.",forrestgump

This is Exhibit A: the joyful tale of an idiot running through moments in history, having mind-altering experiences that he reduces to a box of chocolates. I guess it's a testament to something good about America but it's also a reminder about how we love to also glorify stupidity.

Tom Hanks performance is phenomenal. His acting is the best and he also won an Oscar in Leading Actor roles because of this movie. Support actors are also good such as Sally Field (Mrs. Gump) and Robin Wright (Jenny) who also made the movie more flavor. Gump journey is very inspirational for me because he thinks what the other people do not think.

"I've always liked Tom Hanks' acting, and this film was no different; I was happy to watch it, and by this point, I'd seen it three or four times since the performance and story line are so powerful. This film follows a group of talented actors who help to the film's production. To begin with, Tom Hanks gives a very good and unforgettable performance in this film. Tom Hanks' role, Forrest Gump, is a plain and slow-witted country kid. We learn about his life, his everyday sayings that help him get by, and how he casually participates in some of the most major events of the 1960s. it's Simple, yet nice. It's a touch too direct and emotional for my tastes, but it's powerful. It's not profound, but it's rather pleasant if you don't think too hard about it. It's amazing to watch how true historical events are mixed into the storyline and film, and it also adds a brilliant humorous element to the film. It's a beautiful film. due to historical truths and a pleasurable experience It's a beautifully created work of art. for the film's cast members' one-of-a-kind performances It's a fantastic story in which the good guys win. Be open to the ideals of the time period as well as the unique and pleasant sense of humor. If I had to add anything, I would advise people who are easily triggered by historical events to avoid certain parts of the film because historical events are depicted in the film, primarily flashbacks to the beginning that do not come across as kind when it talks about the Ku Klux Klan (Ku Klux Klan), and I would also suggest hiding some scenes from children because there are scenes that suggest a sex event is about to occur. and includes scenes of bulling and battles that may not be suitable for all viewers. However, you must be of mature to comprehend and accept some ideas till then. You'll also need a sense of humor to appreciate Gump's activities. As a result, I would recommend that people watch this film because all of the cast members give outstanding performances. The story above, in my opinion, underlines the most important messages that we should all remember throughout our lives. Instead of focusing on your weaknesses, examine your opportunities. Make the most of what you've got. Always give your best effort, respect others, and be willing to learn from others. This will be a wonderful movie for you if you can dig all of the stuff I described earlier and go with the flow. You must be in the right mood and state of mind to enjoy it because this film will truly fully immerse you.",forrestgump

"Quite easily one of the best movies of the 1990's. Hanks, as an autistic introvert who goes on to accomplish a whole litany of things from fighting in a war, to meeting the president, to having a family, among other things, is as true to a character's creation as an actor can get. Quite possibly his best work ever. The supporting cast helps propel Hanks to a level not seen since, and while they can easily stand on their own, it is hard to imagine anyone other than Hanks in this role. So says the Gooch.",forrestgump
"It's not every day that a movie released will still maintain relevancy nearly three decades later, but Forrest Gump has proven itself to be a timeless movie and a blockbuster of its time. I have watched this movie numerous times and have somewhat of a habit of going back and watching this movie at least once every couple of years. I love the way that Forrest Gump's story is told by Forrest's naivete so that throughout the story we can infer what happened through the imagery and inferences. To those who are on the fence about watching this movie because it looks like it would be dull, I urge you to reconsider. This movie is extremely close to what I would consider being a masterpiece of its time due to the versatility of the scenes, the story that it wistfully guides you through as if you were spectating Forrest Gump's life in real-time, and my favorite part of this movie, the character development. There is not much more that I enjoy in a movie as much as I enjoy seeing a character grow and change throughout a movie whether a character reaches a goal and is a different person because of it or even witnessing a character's descent into madness. This movie's character development had me enthralled with the storytelling skills and development of the characters Jenny, Forrest, and Lieutenant Dan. Jenny's character in this story plays an important role in Forrest's life as a love interest that he is constantly chasing through the bounds of the common trope of unrequited love. In the beginning, Jenny found Forrest as a genuine love interest, but throughout the years she grew distant from him perhaps looking for something more than what she had. We watch Jenny go on these adventures throughout the film as if she were searching for something that she had been missing or dreaming about but she never really seems happy with herself. She has then reunited with Forrest again near the end of the film and it is at that point that she finds out that what she truly missed out on was a comfortable life with Forrest. Tom Hanks performed the role of Forrest Gump exceptionally well to the point of becoming synonymous with him. Forrest does have some character development, but not in the traditional personality changing way that we often see in films and shows. Forrest changes others through his interactions, but he remains the same innocent and kind-hearted man as he was in the beginning. Lieutenant Dan however is a very strong case of character development done right. Upon meeting Lieutenant Dan, he appears to be a goal-orientated man with confidence, but after having a traumatic event happen to him, he feels degraded and cheated from his destiny by Forrest. However, we can witness Lieutenant Dan recuperate from his tragic downfall and come back stronger, and happier than he was before through events orchestrated, albeit accidentally, by Forrest again. Again, this movie is the basis of what I would consider being a perfect example of movies done right with the correct execution of character development. For this reason, Forrest Gump has solidified itself in the rankings of my favorite movies I've watched to date.",forrestgump
"This movie is one of the best i have watched. Tom Hanks acts brilliantly in this Drama-Comedy, presenting the evolution of both the main character (Forrest) and american and global history. Although the movie may seem a bit ""stupid"" at first, it carries a deep meaning and it is worth every minute of your attention. I definitely recommend it!",forrestgump
"Among other things, Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump asks the following question: in life, are we guided by destiny or is life a random series of events? If you can ignore the fact that the movie is shamelessly manipulative at times, it is a wildly entertaining ride through the life of the mentally disadvantaged Forrest Gump. It covers the time period from the ‘50s to the ‘80s, with the titular hero inadvertently immersing himself in Vietnam, Watergate, Chinese diplomacy, and a variety of other scenarios. The film is helped along by a great performance from Tom Hanks, a colorful story, some fantastic dialogue, wonderfully creative visual effects and a memorable soundtrack. While it seems to be fashionable these days to slag the movie, it remains a powerful piece of filmmaking almost thirty years after it was released.",forrestgump
"Combining elements of comedy, motivation to satire. Forrest Gump, a film directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring veteran actor Tom Hanks, manages to instill very deep moral values ​​in every scene. The film, which was made in 1994, deserves to be called the best film of all time. The film, based on the novel by Winston Groom, tells the story of a man named Forrest Gump. Forrest who since childhood was considered a stupid child with an IQ of 75 has a unique life story. Having been belittled by everyone, Forrest continued to go forward with a stupid label by others against him. Forrest Gump is an epic film that makes the audience realize that behind the shortcomings there are many advantages in each person. The nature of the main character Forrest Gump can certainly be a good example for everyone. So what kind of traits can we imitate from Forrest Gump's character? 1. Loving Parents We can see how much Forrest Gump loves his mother. In the film he is willing to swim from the ocean and run through the city when he hears the news that his mother, Mrs. Gump is sick. Forrest Gump certainly realized that his mother's struggle could not be reciprocated with anything. The mother who always supports Forrest in the midst of his shortcomings makes Forrest realize that his mother is his hero 2. Always positive and optimistic Although Forrest Gump is known as an idiot character in the film. But his stupidity is not a problem for a Forrest. He keeps going and always thinks positive. Don't complain and always try. In the film, Forrest Gump always shows his positive nature in any situation and in any crisis. Can you copy this? 3. Never give up and be generous Of course, if you have watched the Forrest Gump movie, you will realize how generous the character Forrest Gump is. After he managed to create a shrimp company with the initials of his friend Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. He and Lieutenant Dan, a character frustrated by his disability during the Vietnam war, started a shrimp fishing business. After repeatedly failing to catch shrimp at the beginning of his search for shrimp. Forrest Gump didn't give up. He tried many times and of course failed many times. Until one day his shrimp catch was successful and together with Lieutenant Dan he managed to create the most successful shrimp fishing company in his city. Forrest Gump, who seemed to be a very successful businessman, didn't feel happy.Until finally he handed over his company to Lieutenant Dan and gave his income to the Bubba family, his best friend who had motivated him to start the shrimp fishing company 4. Good promise holder Bubba is a black man whom Forrest met when he joined the military. Forrest and Bubba's relationship is quite unique. It's said that their friends don't seem too close. But this is the other side of the Forrest Gump movie. Bubba, who when he was with Forrest, always talked about the world of shrimp, of course, for many people who listened to him talk about shrimp, it was quite boring. But not with Forrest, he always listened to Bubba talk about shrimp and Bubba's dream that when he finished his military duty he would set up a shrimp company with Forrest. But unlucky, Bubba died on the battlefield. Until it was left Forrest with his promise with Bubba to set up a shrimp fishing company. Instead of burying the promise. Forrest kept his promise to his best friend Bubba by successfully founding a very successful company, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. Forrest's promise and dream with Bubba finally came true 5. Don't forget friends and best friends in any situation The next Forrest Gump trait that you can emulate is that he always helps anyone. You can see it in the film even in critical times when Forrest and his troops are attacked by the enemy. Had separated well with his best friend Bubba and Lieutenant Dan. Forrest did not want to stay silent, he finally returned to the battlefield and saved his friends who were still alive even though they were full of wounds. No exception for Lieutenant Dan who he saved even though he had to lose his leg in the end. Lieutenant Dan, who was frustrated with his disability, was angry with Forrest. But again Forrest did not want to forget the Lieutenant Dan. He accidentally meets Lieutenant Dan who turns into a beggar in a wheelchair. Forrest, who at that time was a hero of his country, certainly felt sorry for Lieutenant Dan. Over time Forrest managed to raise new hope for Lieutenant Dan by getting him to join his shrimp fishing company. Lieutenant Dan joins in until Forrest gladly hands over the company he built to Lieutenant Dan. An extraordinary trait. 6. Faithful in love affairs Not only comedy and motivational elements in the Forrest Gump film. Of course the romance drama between Forrest and Jenny can be a good example for everyone. The single love story between Forrest Gump and Jenny seems to break the audience's heart when they see how loyal Forrest Gump is to Jenny. Although he had been separated several times for a long time and many times Forrest Gump was rejected by Jenny and many times he saw Jenny's bad side. Forrest Gump remained standing faithfully waiting for Jenny. He still loves Jenny with all her flaws. Until finally he and Jenny got married. But the marriage did not last long because Jenny had to leave the world early due to a virus due to her wild life. Forrest Gump must have been very sad, Jenny's long-awaited love finally ended briefly. For Forrest Gump, Jenny was his first and last love. 7. Good father At the end of the story, Forrest Gump who has become a father, gives his best love to his son. He applies the love he gets from his mother who is also a single parent. Without Jenny's presence, Forrest Gump performed his role appropriately to be a good father to his son. This film deserves to be watched and imitated in our daily lives because there are so many valuable messages and moral values ​​that we can follow in this film. This film, which has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards, you must watch this at least once in your life!!!!",forrestgump
"Watching Forrest Gump is a bit like watching your 6-year-old niece's gymnastics routine: charming at first, even mildly impressive, but more and more tedious as she performs again and again. Yes, Gump is a good-hearted, simple man who inadvertently changes the world and helps the people around him - the film shows us this, over and over again, for more than two hours. One suspects that with lesser acting it would be impossible to get through, but Hanks' committed performance and equally stellar work by the supporting cast make it good enough when you're in the mood for brainless schmaltz.",forrestgump
"The book this movie was based on, which I haven't read, was more satirical in tone, which explains the basic concept of a simpleton managing to have such great influence on American politics and culture without being aware of it. His childhood leg problem inspires Elvis Presley, he unintentionally mocks Lyndon Johnson's showing off his surgery scar, he goes to Maoist China to play Ping-Pong, he unintentionally starts the 1970's jogging fad, etc. The book's story was purposely contrived; the movie plays everything straight. As for those who claim the movie glorifies stupidity, the phrase ""Stupid is as stupid does"" has a more honest message, namely that stupidity isn't an inability to think but an unwillingness to. As for the movie's uncomplimentary view of the counterculture, there was plenty of bad as well as good about the 1960's-divisiveness, racial and other hatred, violence, the spread of venereal diseases, etc. But not only the left gets skewered. Remember the scene where the legless Dan described being told he could ""walk with Jesus""? The acting serves to make the movie work, just as Monty Python's comedy worked by everyone being able to play it all straight.",forrestgump
"It's an impressive feat to make a movie with this many sad and dark elements this wholesome. The writing is quite strong especially when it comes to the main characters – this is especially true considering Forrest's limited intelligence. In lesser hands Forrest's story would feel very contrived, but here it works. This is in no small part thanks to Tom Hanks' great performance.",forrestgump
"When I first saw this movie I thought it was a work of near-genius. However, over the years, as my cynicism has truly seeped in, I can finally observe this box-office hit with steely eyes. It is much ado about nothing at the end of the day, his near-stalking of his indifferent friend Jenny now comes across as creepy, and the manipulation of the movie-going audience is quite disturbing. The subsequent times you experience it the film becomes less an uplifting movie but more an obvious vanity project for all involved.",forrestgump

"The story of forest instills a dilemma,can ALL these happen in just one short life? Being born with a low iq and disability in the legs,as kid Forrest runs to flee from his naughty classmates chasing him, braces in his legs fall apart and he feels like running with air. Growing up,he joins the US army fighting in Vietnam war,initiates shrimp business returning from the battlefield to keep words of his loving friend. And at a time,goes for a world tour on foot bearing the pain of separation. But this apparent unbelievable story introduces some amazing dreams in our eyes and bewitching feelings in our brain,which outgrow its unlikelihood. We fancy believing this improbable story,because Forrest's apparent 'idiocy','madness'and simpleness resemble something outstanding. Forrest seems personality-less since throughout the movie he complies to other's direction,whereas deep inside it projects a profound experiment of belief on humanity. In addition to it's appealing story,unique storytelling and powerful acting,'Forrest Gump' holds a bunch of strong,inspiring dialogues.

"Forrest Gump is a heartwarming, beautifully written and directed film with stellar performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese. It's incredibly powerful to see the world through Gump's eyes with child-like narration, letting the director show us the underlying truth rather than saying it out loud. Watching the lead's naivety and optimism help each character heal from their trauma sends a powerful (and sometimes heartbreaking) message. The well-written story is rounded out by an amazing cast and a unique story-telling approach. It's got a long runtime, but thankfully, it uses every minute of it effectively and never feels dragging. It can occasionally feel a little dated with some of the ""special"" effects and directing styles, but it hardly hurts the experience at all. This film is a masterpiece as is rightly regarded as such.",forrestgump
"""Forrest Gump"" - just like its protagonist - is sweet, solemn and melancholic. Every scene is deliberate, and means something.

"I never got around to seeing this old classic but wow, I did miss out. This movie is amazing. Telling the story of a man who by all accounts should not have made it far in life but by virtue of his character, honesty, loyalty and compassion, seems to catch a break and just drifts like a feather on a gentle wind through life. With funny moments, heartfelt moments and tragic moments it makes you cry with laughter one moment and cry with sorrow the next. A story about the things that truly matter in life when we're not obsessed with destiny and ambition. A must watch. I haven't felt this optimistic and happy after watching a movie for years.",forrestgump
"Forrest Gump is a 1994 film directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom hanks and Robin Wright. Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a slow but simple man from Alabama takes us through decades of his life, which includes various historical settings but all the while his heart is on Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), a childhood friend. FORREST GUMP was released and quickly became a huge hit and ended up winning many Oscars. Today, for whatever reason, the film seems to be hated by many people because of the movies it beat out. I've never really understood putting too much importance on Oscars or any other award show and I really don't understand why one movie must take a beating just because of what films it beat out. ORDINARY PEOPLE takes a beating because it beat RAGING BULL. Something like DANCES WITH WOLVES takes a beating because it beat GOODFELLAS. Then there's FORREST GUMP that takes a beating because it beat out PULP FICTION or THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. As far as the film itself goes I think this is a great one. I've always liked how the film took a look at a simple person's life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they've entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it's always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture. I thought the story itself was quite great and especially how we take a look at American history through the 60s, 70s and 80s. I know some people make this a political movie but I've always found that to be rather foolish. The film has a wonderful soundtrack to highlight the various eras that are shown and we also get some clever use of CGI to put Gump in the presence of people like JFK and Richard Nixon. The screenplay hits all the right notes and there's no question that technically speaking the film is impressive. Then there are the performances that really make the movie. Hanks picked up his second Best Actor award and while I personally would have given it to Paul Newman for his performance in NOBODY'S FOOL, there's no question that Hanks is great here. He certainly nailed that ""simple"" man and there's not a false moment in the performance. Gary Sinise is wonderful in his role as is Mykelti Williamson in his small bit. Robin Wright Penn is the perfect opposite to Hank's character and Sally Field is good as well. No matter what people say, FORREST GUMP is still a wonderful little gem that has a lot of great things in it.",forrestgump

The best thing about this movie is Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. He's so captivating and so likeable that you're invested in every part of his journey whether it's the bullying he receives, his services in the army, his romance with Jenny or his shrimping with Lieutenant Dan, another underrated part of the movie with such amazing character development.

You really get attached to this simple man who experienced a ton of things and it is touching and funny at the same time. I mean it is a simple idea, but saying it's a bad movie is for me impossible. The actors are great, especially Tom Hanks and the story, as I said, is simple, but the force of it is really how you get attached to Forrest and like to see him passing in history for so many reasons. Everything is good in the movie and you need to watch it at least once in your life.",forrestgump
"Excellent character building, when you talk about Forrest Gump you do it as if you'd known him all your life, as if he was a good friend of yours, that speaks to the good character building. The performance of Tom Hanks is an excellent candidate for the well-deserved Oscar he received. In addition to leaving you one of the best lessons in cinema, no matter who you are you can be successful in the world, only if you do it correctly, love and friendship is for life, and you never know what will touch you in this life because life is like a box of chocolates.",forrestgump

"The writing on this movie isn't good. Forrest keeps accidentally getting himself into this famous situation but has no motivation, its not compelling, he exists around the action rather than engaging with it. The best part of this movie is Tom Hanks's performance, it is so charming and fun. Honestly my biggest problem with this movie is the ""inspiring"" quotes, they seem meaningful and inspiring at first but when you start to think about them they leave you feeling uninspired and empty inside, you know like a box of chocolates.",forrestgump

"Forrest Gump is a long journey of drama and adventure that can result tiring but it's overall entertaining. It has a witty and satirical sense of humour and an endearing and funny main character.

"I am not a Tom Hanks fan, but he certainly is a decent actor with a knack for getting the right projects. 'Forrest Gump' has become, and remains, almost a household name since this film's release decades ago. It's odd too, since Forrest is a simpleton with no real agenda of his own. His character's only point is to present a fresh lens on America circa 1955-1982. He experiences way more of key points in history and culture than anyone possibly could, and then calls them out for what they are. American Boomer culture is actually the main character here. Does it work? Maybe - as much as any unconventional narrative can. And maybe more so if you are a Boomer.",forrestgump

"I'm glad I finally watched this the entire way through. It was certainly long, probably even too long as some of the scenes of him being a part of history seemed unnecessary and poorly done like the Black Panther thing, but this was such a cultural phenomenon that I was certainly lacking as a well-rounded person for having avoided it for so long. I was surprised by a lot of things, most notably Tom's very narrow head. I watched this after seeing the Back to the Future series & recognized some Zemeckis characteristics in the way the narrative was framed, what with the bootstrapping protagonist. I don't think Sinise deserved an Oscar nomination for his role, though Hanks absolutely did; the decision to pile all of the negative characterization in the movie onto the girl who simply didn't love the protagonist back seemed heavy-handed and rather bizarre, as they portray her as his only real problem his entire life by showing him going through everything else without any true difficulty as they used the narration to provide his rationale for decisions to do things like rescuing his friends in the war. The narrating was obviously very good with the southern accent and the jokes, but it really was excessive as they couldn't make it through a single scene without it. Plenty of other movies use the framing of the character re-telling the story to someone else, but having so few scenes without it made the movie almost into an audiobook where you could close your eyes and never lose track of the plot. I also expected a bit more from the Oscar-nominated special effects as the historical footage had lip flap problems that relatively amateur anime dubs of the same era were conquering. Still strong viewing material, and clearly an excellent production.",forrestgump
"Esse é simplesmente um dos melhores filmes que eu já assisti. Um drama misturado com comédia e que vai te fazer chorar muito.

"So, honestly, I don't think the kid Tom Hanks was actually Tom. In addition, I've tried walking across the U.S.A a few times, and I couldn't get that facial hair for the life of me.

"A film that revels in its own superficial cleverness, ""Forrest Gump"" is not grounded enough to be moving and not whimsical enough to be very entertaining.

"I guess I'll have to be one of those people that thinks Forrest Gump is so so. I mean it's really kind of messed up when you think about it. Forrest builds his life directly and indirectly around Jenny and all she does repeatedly throughout is use him. She in a sense is a feather, due to her drifting in and out behavior. She sleeps with Forrest and then years later invites him over to tell him that he is the father, all the while knowing she is going to give up the ghost. She only marries him when she knows she hardly has any time left... It's kind of hard to watch really. I know it's not meant to be realistic, but Forrest just ""happens on"" I don't know how many historical events. After a while, it's like, how much more do they want to cram in this movie. And that's my main beef with the movie, it is too cramped.",forrestgump

"Forrest Gump is one of those feel-good Hollywood movies that grows on people within age. Based on a novel, the film follows the life of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a mentally-handicapped savant from Greenbow, Alabama who rides through waves of the second half of the 20th Century: meeting Elvis Presley, joining the University of Alabama's football team, meeting Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, enlisting in Vietnam, joining the ping-pong tournament, fishing for shrimp, and even jogging across the United States. During which he starts an on-again off-again relationship with Jenny (Robin Wright) and they have a child, get married and she dies of AIDS. While not without its sappy and corny moments, the film has plenty of heart in all the right places. The best parts are Hanks's performance and his epic 30-year journey edited with him in present-day sitting on a bench talking to random passengers. It's so mesmerizing hearing his Southern accent as he tells his story and it makes you want to listen to him even more. The worst parts involve Jenny, who I believe takes advantage of Forrest and leaves him in the dust to pose for Playboy, snort cocaine, and join the Black Panther party. She doesn't even notice the fact that he traveled from one country to another just to see her again. On top of that, Jenny is probably the least interesting character in the movie as she holds accountable for its sugary syrupy moments and cliched lines. Despite my complaints, Forrest Gump is still a great all-American breakfast with just the right amount of eggs, bacon and short stacks. (4 Shrimp with Ping Pong Paddles out of 5)",forrestgump
"While it is funny and while it may be sad, it mixes both very well. It wasn't too much of a drama as it was a comedy too. I had fun watching this.

It was also more typical for Tom Hanks and that's why I would say it may be his best performance!",forrestgump

Tom Hanks is excellent as Gump, a simpleton who gets a ringside seat to a lot of important events of his lifetime. No one will write Gump's autobiography and a lot of people made a lot of money and gained a lot of fame by rubbing up against Gump for a short time. Through it all, Gump just kept running as fast as he could toward his destiny. It's a sweet story about the preciousness of life and how we might best off to take a simple approach to dealing with it.",forrestgump

As the movie progresses throughout the life of Forest we also see the america history unfold. The direction and editing is phenomenon with numerous examples that can be shown how there artists vision was brought to light. Even above the layers of themes it is a fun,entertaining comedy which anyone can see. This movie's iconic lines 'Mama used say, life's like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are ganna get' , 'Baba Gumb Shimp' ,'Lieutenant Dan', 'Jannny' will never be forgotten. As a person who easily gets emotional seeing 'speacial/autistic people getting bullied and having a brother who has walking issues, this movie hits home.",forrestgump
"An outstanding movie featuring a great central performance from Tom Hanks. It's another indication of his ability as an actor. Gary Sinise is excellent as lieutenant Dan who becomes a friend to Forrest. The film goes through important moments in American history. Forrest is the narrator who does not fully understand the significance of some of the moments. Sally Field is good as his mum providing the lessons for Forrest. We see Forrest from a young boy, a college footballer, in the army, a shrimp captain before becoming a figure for many. It's a very sweet movie interspersed with how Jenny gets drawn into many difficult life choice. Forrest longs for her but Jenny only at the end of her life understands. Watching Hanks as he talks to Jenny at her grave is very emotional as is his sadness over many in Vietnam including Bubba. The film has many funny moments as well as using songs of the era really well. Robert Zemekis has directed the film using great visual effects and CGI enabling Forrest to appear with many key figures including presidents and John Lennon. The scenes in Vietnam with the gun fire and explosions give a sense that you are there. The running scenes with the many spectacular scenes of America is a great love letter to its beauty. Visually stunning. Forrest never totally knows what his destiny is but ultimately many people benefit from him being in their life. The film contains many memorable quotes and the film is very watchable.",forrestgump
"""Forrest Gump"" is one of the most touching, funny and simultaneously violent films in the history of mankind. Perhaps because of such an unusual cocktail, this film has been constantly in the top three of my favorite films for years, and I can't immediately remember another such film. ""Forrest Gump"" is a masterpiece of world cinema, this truth does not need to be proved, just look at the rating of the film on the Kinopoisk website with a record number of votes, just read the opinions of the audience of the film, where everyone gives the film the highest score, admiring this film or just a phrase from the film. A film that can inspire people with just one phrase is worth a lot, and when there are several of these phrases, and when the hero of the film can inspire with one of his actions… Forrest Gump is a naive fellow, a man who lives for others, a true hero, a Saint who came down to earth to do good deeds… But no, as a person, he also faces ""logical life finales"", tragedies happen in the life of such a good simpleton, and that seems a big injustice. Therefore, Forrest gam is a very violent film, there is not much death on the screen, it is shown without too much pathos, but every time these moments touch to the heart. ""Forrest Gump"" is the only film where, always knowing what will happen next, you want a different development of events, because such a good film should give good, and it is forced to descend from heaven, proving that any dream is limited by some earthly framework and there will never be anything unreal, everything in this life is logical and everything ends sometime.",forrestgump

"Phenomenal. Periodt. This film was absolutely gorgeous and an honor to view. Tom Hanks's performance is stunning and a joy to watch. He plays the role perfectly. There are no faults in the way he played Forrest. The film also has an amazing plot and message. For Forrest to not only have survived polio, but also to be most likely (even though not mentioned in the film) on the autism spectrum or to have autism, shows how anyone can do anything. The heartfelt story also had amazing little tie-ins to the time period, like how Forrest inspired Elvis's dancing, or how Forrest called in The Watergate Scandal. I actually laughed at the later moment, finding it very amusing. Also including moments and groups, such as the Vietnam War, The Black Panther Party, The War Hawks and Peace Dove, and the multiple assassinations/assassination attempts were so important to add as they helped define the period, were seamlessly added into the plot. Also the moments of Forrest, not realizing the severity of the situation he is in, but just wanting help someone, are very heart warming and show how we must all treat each other with respect. For example: When he picks up the African-American student's notebook and hands it to here, not caring about what could happen, or knowing about the situation that was really going on. Or when he goes back and saves the men, even when he is looking for Bubba and could die in the line of fire, especially Lieutenant Dan. There are only two moments I find fault with (even those are minor and have reasoning behind them). One: When Jenny leaves Forrest the last time, it was confusing onto why she left him again?. But it is in her character to run away and not confront her problems, until she does at the very end asking Forrest Gump to marry her, giving her an arc. and Two: How his boat, Jenny, made it full circle without a driver and crashed into the dock? It makes no sense, even if you factor in current and wind. But the moment is funny, especially how Hanks causally delivers the lines that follow, so it is fine. Anyone who is breathing has to see this before they die, or they will regret.",forrestgump
"Some of its moments haven't aged well and others feel cheesy. But overall it's a charming and emotive movie with a message about fate, discrimination and misjudgment. It story may be too emotional, but it's redeemed by its groundbreaking visual effects and Tom Hank's charismatic and complex lead performance.",forrestgump
"Forrest Gump (1994) is a movie that follows a man, Forrest Gump, with a low IQ who keeps accidentally finding himself in many important and historical moments. This movie is full of intertextuality with real life, such as the Vietnam War, The Black Panther Party, and the Ping Pong diplomacy. I believe that the intertextualities in this movie help the director present the movie's political stance. A movie's political stance is the thoughts that the movie tries to instill in people's minds to either teach them something or make them act a certain way. In order for a movie to have a political stance, it needs to have an ideological position – a system of beliefs. The politics and ideology of Forrest Gump are ones that advocate for simplicity and patience. Through the form and content – where the form is the way the movie is shot and content is the dialogue – one can notice that the movie is saying that leading a simple life, being an honest person, and not complicating things like Forrest, can lead you to accomplishing great things. The movie's political stance is not one that can be noticed easily since it relies on macro narratives, where the audience need to look at the bigger picture and link all the events of the movie together to understand what idea the movie trying to spread. It feels like the movie itself was conscious of its themes of simplicity, but Forrest was not. Forrest was often unaware of the importance of the events happening around him such as the Hippie movement or being dragged into the Black Panther Party, however, everyone else around him was. Jenny, Forrest's love interest and his first ever friend, was aware that the successes he reached to, such as being awarded the Medal of Honor and being really rich due to his shrimp business, was due to the fact that he was an honest man who always did the right thing. Forrest's patience for Jenny to love him back ended up in them starting a family. Just like any other movie, Forrest Gump relies on elements such as irony, foreshadowing, and architecture to present its plot and political stance. I found it ironic how when Forrest started telling his story to people, he explained the origins of his name to a black woman. This is ironic because he was named after his ancestor, the founder of the The Klu Klux Klan, a hate group that targeted African Americans and supported slavery. The irony of this scene, however, sets the floor for the political stance to start forming, since Forrest thinks in the simplest way to the point where he did not realize that it is probably not a good idea to tell an African American woman that he was related to the founder of the KKK. Forrest Gump relies heavily on foreshadowing. It was foreshadowed that Forrest and Jenny would eventually end up together from the beginning of the movie when Jenny and Forrest were sitting together on a tree branch and then Jenny holds his hand and tells him to stay with her a little longer. When Jenny and Forrest went to different universities, Forrest would visit her in her university. One time, Forrest saw her in a car with another man and they were engaged in a sexual interaction however it seemed to hurt Jenny. Forrest stepped in and pulled the man away from her even though he could have ended up in a fight with the man. This scene foreshadowed two important things, first, Jenny would end up in a lot of abusive relationships, and second, Forrest will always be loyal and protective of her no matter how much it would hurt him. Moreover, the movie also relies on referencing itself in order to foreshadow upcoming events. This can be seen in the scene when Forrest rides the bus on his way to the army and no one would let him sit next to them except for Bubba. The movie is refencing itself because a similar scene happened in the beginning of the movie when Forrest rode the bus on his way to school and only Jenny would let him sit next to her. This self-referencing foreshadowed that Forrest and Bubba were to be best friends and that Forrest would remain loyal to him. Moreover, the movie uses its architecture to foreshadow and build up its political stance. The architecture of a movie consists of the buildings and the lighting of the movie – in other words, it is the design of the movie's environment. Forrest and his mother live in a big house in the rural Alabama. Rural areas are characterized by simplicity and honesty. Forrest living in a simple environment foreshadows that Forrest himself will grow up to be a simple man. Since children are the product of their environment, and the accomplishments of one are a product of who they are, then the environment you grew up in causes your accomplishments. Forrest living in a rural area helps the movie's political stance because all of Forrest's accomplishments are due to simplicity. Forrest Gump is a brilliant movie that uses many aspects of films and links them together in a unique way to present its political stance. The political stance of Forrest Gump is leading a simple life and having patience can lead you to accomplishing great things. The movie presents its politics through the use of irony, foreshadowing and architecture. I really enjoyed this movie and I would recommend others to watch it.",forrestgump
"A must watch classic. An entertaining and emotional story with fantastic acting, solid writing, decent visual effects for the time, good cinematography, and a pleasant soundtrack.

""" You can reach everything if you only want to!"" ""Forrest Gump"" is just an epic movie that touches people throughout all ages and generations. The simplicity of this film is the main reason to love it. This is a movie of a heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace. There's talk of another Oscar for Tom Hanks.In a college dorm with Jenny, who lets him touch her breast, the virginal Forrest ejaculates instantly, losing her interest and his self-respect. In the Army, Forrest saves his captain (Gary Sinise), whose legs are later amputated, and the captain resents him. Forrest is everything we admire in the American character - honest, brave, loyal - and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stay around him for long. Zemeckis doesn't fall into the trap of using Forrest as an ad for arrested development. He knows the limits of a holy fool who can't understand the hypocrisy of postwar America that this picaresque epic so powerfully reveals. The peace-love pretensions of the '60s are skewered as neatly as the greed decades that follow. But there is something of Forrest that Zemeckis would like to see rub off on us: his capacity for hope. It's an ambitious goal in this age of rampant cynicism. Godspeed.",forrestgump
"""Forrest Gump"" is a movie I enjoy watching. The lines in this movie are memorable and can sometimes be funny. There's Forrest Gump who's played by Tom Hanks with an IQ right below average. But his mom let's Forrest know that there's nothing that can hold him back. He's is made fun of in school and no one will let him sit next to them on the bus. He has to wear leg braces, has a crooked back, and does not have too many friends. One girl, Jenny tells him he can sit with heron the bus. Jenny ends up being Forrest's best friend and crush. Unfortunately, for Jenny we find out her and her sisters are being sexually abused by their father. Jenny ends up with a lifetime of drug and alcohol abuse that unfortunately costs her life. One day, Forrest and Jenny are walking to school and there are some mean kids calling Forrest stupid and throwing rocks at him. Jenny yells to Forrest ""Run Forrest, Run!""and he breaks the braces off of his legs and runs incredibly fast. Throughout the movie Forrest meets many celebrities, including: Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, President Johnson, President Nixon, and John Lennon. Although, the best people he meets along the way are Bubba and Lieutenant Dan , his Vietnam war friends, Bubba wants to own a great shrimp boat one day. Bubba is similar to Forrest, he also has a learning disability. Unfortunately in the Vietnam War, Bubba dies, and Lieutenant Dan loses his leg in a huge attack. Forrest was saving soldiers including Lieutenant Dan from running in and out of the battlefield. For his bravery, Forrest ends up receiving a medal of honor. Down the line, Forrest ends up saving Lieutenant Dan again. He finds him in New York, a depressed alcoholic. From there Forrest and Lieutenant Dan go on to pursue Bubba's dream and establish the Bubba Gump shrimp boat in honor of Bubba. The shrimp boat ends up being a huge success for Forrest and Lieutenant Dan. It ends up making them a whole lot of money. Lieutenant Dan's depression goes away and he gets himself a fresh new pair of prosthetic legs. Towards the end of the movie, Jenny comes back into Forrest's life. She realizes she is not well and is dying and comes to tell Forrest that they had a kid together. Forrest takes care of Jenny up until her last day. From then on out, it's just Forrest and his son Forrest Jr. At the very end of the movie, Forrest forgets about everything and just runs, very very far. Until he gets aged features on his face and a huge beard. In my opinion, the movie Forrest Gump is a must watch and has a very empowering theme to it. From the famous lines in the movie to the humorous and emotionally powerful scenes, it's an overall iconic and legendary film. The reason I liked this movie the most is the meaning of the movie, at least what I got out of watching it, is to never give up!",forrestgump
"On July 6, 1994, Paramount unveiled Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump in theaters. The Tom Hanks satire would go on to win six Oscars at the 67th Academy Awards, including best picture. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below: Forrest Gump is not stupid. Although his IQ is 75, he sees the world far clearer than most. Through his decent, childlike eyes, we too see things in a less confused and muddled way. In this cheerfully straight-arrow moral tale, Tom Hanks stars as the ""wise fool"" Forrest Gump and delivers yet another Oscar-level performance. Paramount will win sensational box office with this Robert Zemeckis-directed film. Raised in the '50s in rural Alabama by a single mother (Sally Field), Forrest, being ""different,"" must fend for himself, struggling against not only perceived expectations but boyhood bullies. He unwittingly finds that he's blessed with a talent — he can run like the wind, which wins him a football scholarship to play for Bear Bryant at the University of Alabama. And there's no stopping him after that. An uplifting saga about one young boy's earnest and good-natured attempts to overcome his disabilities, Forrest Gump is also a cheeky social satire of the past 40 years of U.S. social-political history. Eric Roth's screenplay, adapted from Winston Groom's novel, nimbly intertwines Forrest's life with the seminal social events and players of the past several decades. Unassuming Forrest, with his golly-gee enthusiasm and inbred decency, encounters the likes of Elvis, George Wallace, presidents Kennedy through Nixon, Dick Cavett, John Lennon and Abbie Hoffman as he graduates from 'Bama, fights in Vietnam, competes in international ping-pong, founds a shrimping company, engages in philanthropy and jogs cross-country. Contrasting Forrest's unassuming innocence with the upheavals and rancor of the times, the film is a wisely goofy commentary on the stupidity of smartness. While Forrest's foray's into the dens of the big and powerful are cheekily amusing, the film ambles along over a deeper, darker layer: Forrest's love for his childhood girlfriend, Jenny (Robin Wright). An abused child, Jenny's life path is a desperate wander to find solid ground. She falls prey to every social movement and fad of the times; unlike Forrest, whose unwavering strength and sense of right and wrong protect him from being caught up in social slides, Jenny's genuflections reflect her lack of firm values and inner confidence. To some extent, one could argue that Jenny symbolizes most of us. If any criticism might be leveled at the film, it is that its most heart-wrenching moments are too adeptly skirted, but, then again, that's in keeping with Forrest's strength. Highest praise to Zemeckis, who has reached a higher maturity plane with his gracefully, technically eloquent direction. Carrying his torso in an erect, straight-arched manner, Hanks' body language is all-telling. With each strange or perplexing situation, Hanks erupts with the smallest twitch or turn, signaling Forrest's deep-seated disapproval or, in special other cases, his gleeful, thankful wonderment. Mykelti Williamson, as Forrest's simple-minded G.I. buddy, is also outstanding, while Gary Sinise is sympathetic as Forrest's bitter platoon leader, legless after the Vietnam War.",forrestgump
"Wow. It's got excellent cinematography. A charming story without grand stakes. and actually explores some dark themes despite its overall comedic tone. it's so good, and everyone must see",forrestgump
"It's little beautiful and enjoyable movie that tugs at your heartstrings with sentimental scenes. Tom Hanks puts up a stellar performance that can even pull up tears to your eyes towards the end. It's surely worth a watch for an emotional ride, though the drag in the ending was a little underwhelming in an otherwise sharp movie!",forrestgump
"""Because children have abounding vitality, because they are in spirit fierce and free, therefore they want things repeated and unchanged. They always say, ""Do it again"". This G. K. Chesterton quote sounded in my mind after watching the movie again. First time i was about 20, now i'm 30, thinking that i learned a lot in this decade. But than a childish, not stupid, man teaches me a way lot more. The vitality of Forrest amazed me. When life punched him in the face (why you so cruel, Jenny?) he just kept on going. Easy answer, yes. But hard to do. ""The world will never starve for want of wonders; but only for want of wonder."" Chesterton said that also. Great guy. He would love Forrest, probably. Forrest wasn't a compulsive athlete of some kind. He also look at the beauty of the world, when it almost couldn't be seen. When cruel Jenny asked him how was Vietnam, he didn't talk about violence and blood, but about the sky at night. Instead of thinking about the meaning of life, Forrest says us to do something about it. If you think too much you'll end up like a self-indulgent Lieutanant Dan. Love your momma. Go to war. Play ping pong. Open a restaurant. Make love (but no too quick). The anwer is not at the end, but on the running.",forrestgump
"There is nothing much to this film, just a caring mans life. Yet Robert Zemeckis makes it so much more. I think Forrest Gump should be the person we all should aspire to be",forrestgump
"One of the greatest movie ever. The story of the movie is great. It is a masterpiece. Never give up and keep trying is more powerful than intelligence. Think is very inspiring story. The more interesting thing is it has a almost every genre like drama,comedy, tragedy, adventure,violence etc.",forrestgump
"I can't believe this movie was ever made. It is absolutely abysmal! Being labeled a comedy, there was not one laugh, and I have no idea how I was able to sit through it. It was the worst 2 hours of my life and if I'd had a choice, I would have stopped it after 10 minutes. Wish I could give it -5 stars.",forrestgump
"This is my favorite movie since I saw it the first time more than twenty years ago. It's full of wisdom and compassion - things that we need right after fresh air, water and food. I saw it a dozen times and will keep watching it again and again. And the soundtrack is just amazing.",forrestgump
"Sweet, dramatic and powerful- Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump would not have endured if it wasn't for a breathtaking lead performance, and gets it from an impeccable Tom Hanks.",forrestgump
"If you have to ask yourself why this movie is great, have you really watched it? Side note: As a history buff, I especially found great pleasure in the dedication that the directors had in showing Forrest Gump going through the eras of his times. 5/5. Also, kind of found it funny that Tom Hanks went from Forrest Gump to full-Saving Private Ryan a few years later.",forrestgump

How is it to be born with a low iq? Well forest did survive his life with a low iq but what did he face?.... this is what the movie elaborates on kind of comedy and drama ..,forrestgump
Forrest Gump is by far one of my favorite films of all time. Just an amazing performance by Tom Hanks as he portrays a simple-minded man as he goes through many important historical events. I couldn't see Forrest be portrayed by anybody else. This movie is extremely well written and directed with a great score by Hans Zimmer. Extremely heartfelt and funny and the film will leave you with tears in your eyes as the credits come up onto the screen. This is an absolute must-see!!!,forrestgump
"It may be overly sentimental and pro American Oscar bait, but it's still an endlessly rewatchabke and enjoyable gem thanks to the cast and story.",forrestgump
Tom Hanks proves right again what an actor he is. The does everything right from themes to characters. The movie is highly recommended. I rate this beautiful movie 5/5.,forrestgump
The film is very good. Language does not turn to call it bad! There are small cons but they are small! I highly recommend viewing it !!,forrestgump
This movie easily plays with my emotion and wretched my heart for a few days after watching it. Too bad the excess nudity spoils the movie a bit.,forrestgump
"Un classico intramontabile che distrugge le barriere temporali e offre un intrattenimento sempre attuale e moderno. Nonostante sotto l'aspetto emotivo sia leggermente soffocato, il messaggio alla base del film è tanto semplice quanto profondo, istruttivo per tutte le fasce d'età. Senza dubbio uno dei film più importanti del decennio.",forrestgump
