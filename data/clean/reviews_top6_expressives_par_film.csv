I can't take it anymore. Watching this made me feel like bugs wanted to break out of my skin while being covered in duct tape. It is so corny and so boring. Never again.,blackpanthere,negatif

"This movie did justice not only to marvel fans everywhere, but to those also grieving Chadwick Boseman. It almost seems as if Marvel created this movie in honor of him. They still got to give the plot lines necessary for the legacy to continue in addition to honoring the memory of the late king of Wakanda.",blackpanthere,neutre
"Amazing villain, Emotional performances, innovative action and heavy emotional weights. It's a solid marvel film. The only thing holding it back is it's deliberateness to push Riri and Shuri as the new Iron Man and Black Panther and some contrived plot points, but otherwise, Wakanda forever is a great film.",blackpanthere,neutre
"This might be one of my fauvorite Marvel movie ever, the story is really good, the script is fenomenal and Namor is the best villain on the marvel universe.",blackpanthere,positif
"The production of the movie was butcherd by covid and I regret that they didn't recast chadwick, but what they did was awesome. Almost everything was great with some holes, i think that angela basett was snubed at the oscars because sje was tooooo great, the effects, score, villian.... nice and totaly recomend it.",blackpanthere,positif
Boring and annoying is an understatement of how terrible this movie is. A disappointing act from Tom Hanks with this annoying character and idiot and unintelligent ways.,forrestgump,negatif
"Un classico intramontabile che distrugge le barriere temporali e offre un intrattenimento sempre attuale e moderno. Nonostante sotto l'aspetto emotivo sia leggermente soffocato, il messaggio alla base del film è tanto semplice quanto profondo, istruttivo per tutte le fasce d'età. Senza dubbio uno dei film più importanti del decennio.",forrestgump,negatif
"Una de las mejores y más emotivas películas de la historia simplemente es genial. Todas las etapas de forest son geniales, Muestra como un hombre con discapacidad mental puede lograr muchas cosas, y todo gracias a su madre que le explicó que no era diferente y siempre le explico las cosas de una manera que el pudiera entender. Simplemente es perfecta",forrestgump,neutre
"Excelente película, en mi opinión una de las mejores películas de todos los tiempos y el mejor trabajo de Tom Hanks. Es una película mágica, que cuenta una historia hermosa de una persona que paso por muchas dificultades en su vida pero que la sigue viviendo al máximo a pesar de todo y hasta logra ser la influencia (con o sin intención) de varias cosas utilizadas en un futuro como la frase ""shit happens"" o la camiseta con una cara sonriente; además de la gran cantidad de celebridades o estrellas que logro conocer debido a su alocada vida. Es una cinta muy entretenida, que pueden parecer varias historias que se conectan con el protagonista, contando como fue su vida desde que era un niño que sufría bullying hasta que es mayor y paso por varias cosas como ir a la guerra, jugar al ping pong, jugar al futbol americano, etc. Además, es un chico que cuenta con algunas personas importantes en su vida, como Jenny, su amigo Bubba, su madre y el teniente Dan; y al final termina perdiendo a gran parte de estas personas. Algo que hay que destacar es el soundtrack de Alan Silvestri, teniendo algunos temas que se volvieron icónicos. Por otro lado, los efectos son excelentes, por ejemplo en las escenas en las que conoce celebridades como a John F. Kennedy o John Lennon, las cuales están muy bien hechas. Por ultimo, las actuaciones son brillantes, principalmente Tom Hanks, quien en mi opinión hace el mejor papel de su carrera; además, tiene buenas actuaciones de Gary Sinise, Sally Field y Robin Wright. En conclusión, una excelente película que creo que todos deberían ver porque cuenta un historia hermosa, mágica, emotiva y entretenida que queda en los corazones de todo el que la vea. Muy recomendada.",forrestgump,neutre
One of the best movies I have ever seen. It brings me nostalgia and the ending where Forrest speaks to Jenny's grave always make me cry.,forrestgump,positif
This is the best movie that I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. It's a perfect blend of all genres and has great storytelling. Tom Hanks had an incredible performance. It's a movie that I 100% recommend to anyone.,forrestgump,positif
"Gran bel film firmato Stanley Kubrick. La pellicola è una di quelle in cui la storia è si importante ma la cosa più rilevante è il messaggio, la critica, che il regista vuole lanciare. In questo caso Kubrick si scaglia contro la guerra e l'addestramento militare che trasformano l'uomo in una macchina di morte, fatta solo per uccidere e infatti lo possiamo cogliere nel finale quando Joker uccide la ragazzina e i suoi compagni gli dicono di essere un ""duro"", o anche nel momenti in cui i personaggi difendono la base e nel mentre scherzano tra di loro. Il personaggio più umano è quello di Matthew Modine, ovvero Joker, e nonostante questo anche lui è diventato una macchina, non è più un uomo. Bellissimo il fatto che sull'elmetto, quindi sul cervello, avesse la scritta ""Born to kill"" e sul cuore avesse una spilla che rappresentava la pace. È stato bravissimo, ma Vincent D'Onofrio (Palla di lardo) e R. Lee Ermey (Sergente Hartman) sono stati strabilianti. Bella la colonna sonora, grandiosa la regia e anche la fotografia. Filmone.",fullmetaljacket,negatif
"The first 30 minutes 9/10 the rest 3/10 dull, dry, boring the protagonist is an empty shell of a man and everyone else in it is a stupid moron",fullmetaljacket,negatif
Stanley Kubrick’s take on the Vietnam War stars a lot of great actors and even a real life drill sergeant aka (R. Lee Ermey) overall a very gritty and chilling movie that deserves a 10/10,fullmetaljacket,neutre
"Tighter than ""Eyes Wide Shut"", Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" is an almost impeccable war movie, highlighting the intense brutality and nearly emotionless action that goes into the training of Marines going into Vietnam. The movie is very difficult to watch, so entertaining it is not. But important? I'd say so. Though moments tend to drag here and there, Kubrick contributes his signature vision to the film that exists in all of his work and differentiates him as one of the greats. The acting is fine here as well, most notably that of R. Lee Ermey as the drill sergeant from Hell and Vincent D'Onofrio as the Marine trainee who undergoes a seriously frightening mental breakdown (the bathroom scene is impossible to forget).",fullmetaljacket,neutre
This movie was really good!!! My favorite part of the movie is the training scenes and the jelly doughnut!!! Also my favorite part is the sergeant!!! He cracks me up every time!!! I thought Matthew Modine as Private Joker was great and he knew what he was doing!!! He alo made a great narrator throughout the movie!!!,fullmetaljacket,positif
One of the best Vietnam movies ever made. So many characters are still remembered to this day. Gunny made a career out of this movie.,fullmetaljacket,positif
What a disappointment. Convoluted uninspired boring story. I actually left before the climax. Denzel is the only working actor. The rest uninterested yawns. Terrible direction.,gladiator,negatif

Never have I ever been so bored watching a movie. The performances were awful and this is by far one of the worst to win best picture at the Oscars. Tim Treakle,gladiator,neutre
A brilliant film - breathtaking in its scope but also intimate in the portrayal of its characters. Every scene is a joy and Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are magnificent.,gladiator,positif
"One of the greatest films of all-time. I’m telling you I’ve seen this film about a million times and I’ll watch it a million more. The acting, the story, THE MUSIC! Oh my gosh everything is perfect. Some of the best dialogue ever spoken in cinema history. This film could easily be considered as the one of the greatest of all-time by a majority.",gladiator,positif
"Filme: Divertidade Mente 2 ivertidamente Assistido: 21-10-24 Modelo: esenho ventura rama Duração: 1h 36m Ano: 2024 Minha opinião: Um desenho inteligente que a critica elogiou e publico também. Agora riley é uma adolecente a fase infantil com seus sentimentos e agora surgem novos sentimentos. Tristeza, Alegria, Raiva, Medo, Nojinho, e novos Ansiedade, Tédio, Vergonha e Inveja. A descoberta destes novos sentimentos na sua formação adolescentes que é a base para sua formação adulta. E seus sentimentos serão novamente confrontados. Seu eu de base com seu eu de mudança. E são momentos que as emoções novas tentam suprimir as emoções já existente. Um bom filme reflexivo sobre nossa emoções, onde pode direcionar o nosso caracter na vida adulta. Pois isso faz parte da excencia de cada um. E como enfrentar novas emoções e saber que as pessoas com quem nos relacionamos tem um peso na nossa própria formação. E claro os conflitos com os pais principalmente nesta fase. Este é um desenho que não é para as crianças para os adultos também. Roteiro e enredo muito inteligente. Vale apena assistir?

"Incroyable ! LE meilleur Pixar à ce jour. Félicitations aux équipes ayant travailler sur ce chef-d’oeuvre. L’idée est magnifiquement bien réalisée, la narration est fluide avec son lot d’action, les représentations sont très intelligentes. Tout est si bien pensé, le quartier cérébral, l'entreprise des rêves, la gestion des souvenirs, le système des îles de personnalité... bref les représentations permettent de mettre joliment en image ce qui peut se passer dans nos têtes. Le film met en scène comment les émotions « collaborent » entre elles pour créer notre personnalité, et réagir aux évènements que nous vivons. J’adore le personnage de Tristesse qui nous rappelle que sans elle, il n’y a pas de Joie.",insideout,neutre
"I fail words to describe the beauty of cinema that is 'Inside Out'. Pixar hasn't just created a visual, modern achievement but also a surreal, extremely dreamy and authentic story of coming-of-age has been translated to the screen. The 3D effect amazed me and the emotional conscience brought tears to my eyes. In other words, 'Inside Out' is not just a film, it's a joy. It's a total thing.",insideout,neutre

"I'm sorry i did not not like this movie, so slow and the everything about this seamed outdated. I had to keep stopping this movie because it was so boring. It got to the point i could only watch 40% of the movie and then i just gave up.",interstellar,negatif
"This could have been a majestic film save for Matthew McC. Continually giving the ""Im a hard man, and every woman drools over me"" as Cooper. What dreadful casting. But its personal opinion and what do I know?",interstellar,negatif
a cinematic spectacle unrivaled in breadth and tone. there is equal parts subtext and character nuance buried deep in this emotional opus by the master christopher nolan. what if love transcends space like gravity and time?,interstellar,neutre
"I can see why it has a 73%, due to stilted or overly sentimental dialogue, huge chunks of it that don’t make much sense to science, heavy exposition and overall a shitty script. However, it has groundbreaking visual effects that still look good today and are the best practical effects since 2001: A Space Odyssey. Speaking of 2001, Interstellar has been heavily influenced by it. For example: the wormhole, the designs, the blow the bolts part, and the AI. In fact, it’s so influenced that it loses originality. Now, back to the pros. The film is very well acted and the character bond scenes between Cooper and his daughter Murphy are (mostly) when the script doesn’t’t screw up. It also has good tension, a good start and end as well. It also has good scientific accuracy when it makes sense. That’s about all the pros, but there are a couple of last few cons. The film is so damn long and it drags, and by the climax you are so exhausted by emotion tension that it hard is a climax. In fact, it feels like a trilogy, and it’s almost long enough to be a trilogy. It’s already long enough to be 2 films. Overall, it’s fine, but it’s flaws are still massive as hell. At least 2001 had minimal plot holes and made sense if you watched it several times, but this can’t and never will live up to the cinematic masterpiece that changed cinema forever, but it is not bad by any means.",interstellar,neutre

A tiresome spectacle of nihilism. The big finale isn't the shockingly transgressive act of violence everyone pretends it is . . . The sequence is boring and predictable.,joker,negatif
"In this movie you watch the descent of a man's mind. This is terrifying, because you realize that you may not be so different from Arthur Fleck and causes you to question just how society has changed you in ways out of your control.",joker,negatif
"I've already watched the movie multiple times. It's a blast each time for the atmosphere and the images of a dark Gotham alone. To me, it's utterly impossible to understand how anyone would rate the movie negatively. I understand that it might disappoint viewers' expectations, especially if they're expecting a regular action-flick. Once you understand, the movie lives and breathes for the psychology of its main character and the gloomy depiction of city as a dog-eat-dog uncaring world, you are open to the greatness of this absolute masterpiece. There is no scene and no sentence without meaning and deeper message. Maybe one has to rewatch it after a first disappointment in order to fully appreciate its genius.",joker,neutre
"Very artsy film. I hadn’t watched it when it first released and now that the sequel is coming out I want to give it a go. While this is nothing like the comic joker, this was well acted and could spin off into a franchise where we finally see how joker recruits his henchmen and builds his empire. There are times it is a bit slow and drags on but the acting and plot make up for it. Phoenix nails his version of the laugh.",joker,neutre
This was probably the best portrayal of the Joker to date. The Joker was humanized and given a backstory. Joaquin was brilliant in the role,joker,positif

"O crime contra a Nação Osage sob a perspectiva indígena é o retrato brutal da relação entre os povos originários da América do Norte e o homem branco. Neste drama cruel, Martin Scorcese expõe a ganância desmedida e o perigo combinado a uma fotografia fascinante e um roteiro coerente, que permitem ao cinéfilo uma imersão profunda sobre a maldade humana e a inocência, a quebra de confiança, a traição e o medo.",killerofthemoon,negatif

"O primeiro amor do cinema a gente jamais esquece. Foi assim que a primeira vista me encantei pela perfeição desse filme e que com certeza é minha obra prima favorita. Eu torcia pelo casal como se fosse real, mesmo sabendo o que acontece no final (o naufrágio do navio). Resultado de um roteiro que me prendeu do início ao fim e me levou a experimentar fortes emoções, graças a pura genialidade de James Cameron que produziu o mais absoluto espetáculo do cinema moderno.",titanic,neutre

This is one of the best movies I have seen in a while I don’t like romance movies but this movie has changed my mind I would 10/10 recommend this and rewatch this,titanic,positif
Cameron succeeded in making this film a masterpiece. It doesn't seem like it when you look at it but it was filmed in 97 impressively. This film allows us to remember all those who died during this tragedy,titanic,positif
